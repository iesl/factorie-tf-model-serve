EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb . 

Peter Blackburn 

BRUSSELS 0000-00-00 

The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep . 

Germany 's representative to the European Union 's veterinary committee Werner <OOV> said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer . 

" We do n't support any such recommendation because we do n't see any grounds for it , " the Commission 's chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing . 

He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union . 

He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health . 

Fischler proposed EU-wide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease . 

But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 's standing veterinary committee , <OOV> animal health officials , questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health . 

Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers ' meeting of causing unjustified alarm through " dangerous generalisation . " 

. 

Only France and Britain backed Fischler 's proposal . 

The EU 's scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials . 

Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a brain-wasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . 

British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe . 

" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , " Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio . 

Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef . 

Germany imported 00,000 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports . 

It brought in 0,000 tonnes of British mutton , some 00 percent of overall imports . 

Rare Hendrix song draft sells for almost $ 00,000 . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

A rare early handwritten draft of a song by U.S. guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was sold for almost $ 00,000 on Thursday at an auction of some of the late musician 's favourite possessions . 

A Florida restaurant paid 00,000 pounds ( $ 00,000 ) for the draft of " Ai n't no telling " , which Hendrix penned on a piece of London hotel stationery in late 0000 . 

At the end of a January 0000 concert in the English city of Nottingham he threw the sheet of paper into the audience , where it was retrieved by a fan . 

Buyers also snapped up 00 other items that were put up for auction by Hendrix 's former girlfriend Kathy Etchingham , who lived with him from 0000 to 0000 . 

They included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by Hendrix to store his drugs , which an anonymous Australian purchaser bought for 0,000 pounds ( $ 0,000 ) . 

The guitarist died of a drugs overdose in 0000 aged 00 . 

China says Taiwan spoils atmosphere for talks . 

BEIJING 0000-00-00 

China on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing . 

Speaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan , Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters : " The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities . " 

State media quoted China 's top negotiator with Taipei , Tang Shubei , as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks . 

" Now is the time for the two sides to engage in political talks ... 

that is to end the state of hostility , " Thursday 's overseas edition of the People 's Daily quoted Tang as saying . 

The foreign ministry 's Shen told Reuters Television in an interview he had read reports of Tang 's comments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan , which Beijing considers a renegade province . 

China , which has long opposed all Taipei efforts to gain greater international recognition , was infuriated by a visit to Ukraine this week by Taiwanese Vice President Lien .

Israel plays down fears of war with Syria . 

Colleen Siegel 

JERUSALEM 0000-00-00 

Israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup . 

Itamar Rabinovich , who as Israel 's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria , told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight . 

" It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate . 

The Syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , " he said . 

Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador . 

He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar , a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician . 

Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message , via Washington , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions . 

But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere . 

Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile . 

It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes . 

" The message that we sent to ( Syrian President Hafez <OOV> ) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , " Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview . 

Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 0000 Middle East war . 

Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 0000 despite the previous government 's willingness to make Golan concessions . 

Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February . 

" The voices coming out of Damascus are bad , not good . 

The media ... 

are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ... 

this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , " Levy said . 

" We expect from Syria , if its face is to peace , that it will answer Israel 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , " he said . " 

We do not want a war , God forbid . 

No one benefits from wars . " 

Israel 's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a " calming signal " to Israel . 

It gave no source for the report . 

Netanyahu and Levy 's spokesmen said they could not confirm it . 

The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo , the United States and Moscow . 

Polish diplomat denies nurses stranded in Libya . 

TUNIS 0000-00-00 

A Polish diplomat on Thursday denied a Polish tabloid report this week that Libya was refusing exit visas to 000 Polish nurses trying to return home after working in the North African country . 

" This is not true . 

Up to today , we have no knowledge of any nurse stranded or kept in Libya without her will , and we have not received any complaint , " the Polish embassy 's charge d'affaires in Tripoli , Tadeusz <OOV> , told Reuters by telephone . 

Poland 's labour ministry said this week it would send a team to Libya to investigate , but <OOV> said the probe was prompted by some nurses complaining about their work conditions such as non-payment of their salaries . 

He said that there are an estimated 000 Polish nurses working in Libya . 

Two Iranian opposition leaders meet in Baghdad . 

Hassan <OOV> 

BAGHDAD 0000-00-00 

An Iranian exile group based in Iraq vowed on Thursday to extend support to Iran 's Kurdish rebels after they were attacked by Iranian troops deep inside Iraq last month . 

A Mujahideen Khalq statement said its leader Massoud Rajavi met in Baghdad the Secretary-General of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran ( KDPI ) Hassan <OOV> on Wednesday and voiced his support to Iran 's rebel Kurds . 

" Rajavi emphasised that the Iranian Resistance would continue to stand side by side with their Kurdish compatriots and the resistance movement in Iranian Kurdistan , " it said . 

A spokesman for the group said the meeting " signals a new level of cooperation between Mujahideen Khalq and the Iranian Kurdish oppositions " . 

Iran heavily bombarded targets in northern Iraq in July in pursuit of KDPI guerrillas based in Iraqi Kurdish areas outside the control of the government in Baghdad . 

Iraqi Kurdish areas bordering Iran are under the control of guerrillas of the Iraqi Kurdish Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) group . 

PUK and Iraq 's Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions , have had northern Iraq under their control since Iraqi forces were ousted from Kuwait in the 0000 Gulf War . 

Clashes between the two parties broke out at the weekend in the most serious fighting since a <OOV> ceasefire last year . 

Mujahideen Khalq said Iranian troops had also been shelling KDP positions in <OOV> region in Suleimaniya province near the Iranian border over the last two days . 

It said about 000 Iraqi Kurds were killed or wounded in the attack . 

Both Iran and Turkey mount air and land strikes at targets in northern Iraq in pursuit of their own Kurdish rebels .

Israel approves Arafat 's flight to West Bank . 

JERUSALEM 0000-00-00 

Israel gave Palestinian President Yasser Arafat permission on Thursday to fly over its territory to the West Bank , ending a brief Israeli-PLO crisis , an Arafat adviser said . 

" The problem is over . 

The president 's aircraft has received permission to pass through Israeli airspace but the president is not expected to travel to the West Bank before Monday , " Nabil Abu <OOV> told Reuters . 

Arafat had been scheduled to meet former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres in the West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday but the venue was changed to Gaza after Israel denied flight clearance to the Palestinian leader 's helicopters . 

Palestinian officials accused right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to stop the Ramallah meeting by keeping Arafat grounded . 

Arafat subsequently cancelled a meeting between Israeli and PLO officials , on civilian affairs , at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank . 

Abu <OOV> said Arafat had decided against flying to the West Bank on Thursday , after Israel lifted the ban , because he had a busy schedule in Gaza and would not be free until Monday . 

Arafat to meet Peres in Gaza after flight ban . 

JERUSALEM 0000-00-00 

Yasser Arafat will meet Shimon Peres in Gaza on Thursday after Palestinians said the right-wing Israeli government had barred the Palestinian leader from flying to the West Bank for talks with the former prime minister . 

" The meeting between Peres and Arafat will take place at Erez checkpoint in Gaza and not in Ramallah as planned , " Peres ' office said . 

Palestinian officials said the Israeli government had barred Arafat from overflying Israel in a Palestinian helicopter to the West Bank in an attempt to bar the meeting with Peres . 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused opposition leader Peres , who he defeated in May elections , of trying to undermine his Likud government 's authority to conduct peace talks . 

Afghan UAE embassy says Taleban guards going home . 

Hilary Gush 

DUBAI 0000-00-00 

Three Afghan guards brought to the United Arab Emirates last week by Russian hostages who escaped from the Taleban militia will return to Afghanistan in a few days , the Afghan embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Thursday . 

" Our ambassador is in touch with the UAE foreign ministry . 

Their return to Afghanistan will take place in two or three days , " an embassy official said . 

" The embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland . 

There is no objection to their travel , " he added . 

The three Islamic Taleban guards were overpowered by seven Russian aircrew who escaped to UAE state Sharjah last Friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of Taleban militia in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan . 

The UAE said on Monday it would hand over the three to the International Red Crescent , possibly last Tuesday . 

It has since been silent on the issue . 

When asked whether the three guards would travel back to Kandahar or the Afghan capital Kabul , the embassy official said : " That has not been decided , but possibly Kandahar . " 

Kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia . 

Kabul is controlled by President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government , which Taleban is fighting to overthrow . 

The embassy official said the three men , believed to be in their <OOV> , were currently in Abu Dhabi . 

He did not elaborate . 

The Russians , working for the Aerostan firm in the Russian republic of Tatarstan , were taken hostage after a Taleban <OOV> fighter forced their cargo plane to land in August 0000 . 

Taleban said its shipment of ammunition from Albania was evidence of Russian military support for Rabbani 's government . 

Moscow said the crew 's nationality was coincidental . 

Numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed . 

The Russians , who said they overpowered the guards -- two armed with Kalashnikov automatic rifles -- while doing regular maintenance work on their Ilyushin 00 cargo plane last Friday , left the UAE capital Abu Dhabi for home on Sunday . 

Iraq 's Saddam meets Russia 's Zhirinovsky . 

BAGHDAD 0000-00-00 

Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has told visiting Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky that Baghdad wanted to maintain " friendship and cooperation " with Moscow , official Iraqi newspapers said on Thursday . 

" President Saddam Hussein stressed during the meeting Iraq 's keenness to maintain friendship and cooperation with Russia , " the papers said . 

They said Zhirinovsky told Saddam before he left Baghdad on Wednesday that his Liberal Democratic party and the Russian Duma ( parliament ) " are calling for an immediate lifting of the embargo " imposed on Iraq after its 0000 invasion of Kuwait . 

Zhirinovsky said on Tuesday he would press the Russian government to help end U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq and blamed Moscow for delaying establishment of good ties with Baghdad . 

" Our stand is firm , namely we are calling on ( the Russian ) government to end the economic embargo on Iraq and resume trade ties between Russia and Iraq , " he told reporters . 

Zhirinovsky visited Iraq twice in 0000 . 

Last October he was invited to attend the referendum held on Iraq 's presidency , which extended Saddam 's term for seven more years .

German farm ministry tells consumers to avoid British mutton . 

BONN 0000-00-00 

Germany 's Agriculture Ministry suggested on Wednesday that consumers avoid eating meat from British sheep until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to the animals . 

" Until this is cleared up by the European Union 's scientific panels -- and we have asked this to be done as quickly as possible -- ( consumers ) should if at all possible give preference to sheepmeat from other countries , " ministry official Werner <OOV> told ZDF television . 

" I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers , " he added . " 

There are too many holes in what we know , and these must be filled very quickly . " 

Bonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis , which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef . 

The European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified . 

EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains , spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BSE ) -- mad cow disease . 

But some members of the EU 's standing veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health . 

The question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees . 

Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie , a similar brain-wasting disease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste . 

British officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat . 

ZDF said Germany imported 00,000 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports . 

It brought in 0,000 tonnes of British mutton , some 00 percent of overall imports . 

After the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent , the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports . 

EU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease .

Sir Mark Prescott landed his first group one victory in 00 years as a trainer when his top sprinter <OOV> , a 000-00 chance , won the <OOV> Stakes on Thursday . 

The three-year-old , partnered by veteran George Duffield , snatched a short head verdict in the last stride to deny <OOV> ( 00-0 ) , trained by Henry Candy and ridden by Chris Rutter . 

Hever Golf Rose ( 00-0 ) , last year 's Prix de l ' <OOV> winner at Longchamp , finished third , a further one and a quarter lengths away with the 0-0 favourite Mind Games in fourth . 

<OOV> , a Royal Ascot winner in June , may now be aimed at this season 's <OOV> , Europe 's top sprint race . 

Prescott , reluctant to go into the winner 's enclosure until the result of the photo-finish was announced , said : " Twenty-five years and I have never been there so I thought I had better wait a bit longer . " 

He added : " It 's very sad to beat Henry Candy because I am godfather to his daughter . " 

Like Prescott , Jack Berry , trainer of Mind Games , had gone into Thursday 's race in search of a first group one success after many years around the top of his profession . 

Berry said : " <OOV> disappointed but I do n't feel suicidal . 

He ( Mind Games ) was going as well as any of them one and a half furlongs ( 000 metres ) out but he just did n't quicken . "

Kenny Dalglish spoke on Thursday of his sadness at leaving Blackburn , the club he led to the English premier league title in 0000-00 . 

Blackburn announced on Wednesday they and Dalglish had parted by mutual consent .

He added : " If no one asked , I never opened my mouth . 

I have stayed out of the way and let them get on with the job . 

The club thought it ( the job ) had run its course and I came to the same conclusion . "

TENNIS - <OOV> <OOV> HIS DAVIS CUP <OOV> . 

SYDNEY 0000-00-00 

Australian Davis Cup captain John Newcombe on Thursday signalled his possible resignation if his team loses an away tie against Croatia next month . 

The former Wimbledon champion said the immediate future of Australia 's Davis Cup coach Tony Roche could also be determined by events in Split . 

" If we lose this one , Tony and I will have to have a good look at giving someone else a go , " Newcombe was quoted as saying in Sydney 's Daily Telegraph newspaper . 

Australia face Croatia in the world group qualifying tie on clay from September 00-00 . 

Under Newcombe 's leadership , Australia were relegated from the elite world group last year , the first time the <OOV> Davis Cup winners had slipped from the top rank . 

Since taking over as captain from Neale Fraser in 0000 , Newcombe 's record in tandem with Roche , his former doubles partner , has been three wins and three losses . 

Newcombe has selected Wimbledon semifinalist Jason Stoltenberg , Patrick Rafter , Mark Philippoussis , and Olympic doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde to face the Croatians . 

The home side boasts world number six Goran Ivanisevic , and Newcombe conceded his players would be hard-pressed to beat the Croatian number one . 

" We are ready to fight to our last breath -- Australia must play at its absolute best to win , " said Newcombe , who described the tie as the toughest he has faced as captain . 

Australia last won the Davis Cup in 0000 , but they were beaten finalists against Germany three years ago under Fraser 's guidance .

Baltimore Orioles manager Davey Johnson will miss Thursday night 's game against the Seattle Mariners after being admitted to a hospital with an irregular heartbeat .

Measles exposure can lead to bowel disease - study . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

Women who get measles while pregnant may have babies at higher risk of Crohn 's disease , a debilitating bowel disorder , researchers said on Friday . 

Three out of four Swedish babies born to mothers who caught measles developed serious cases of Crohn 's disease , the researchers said . 

Dr Andrew Wakefield of the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine and colleagues screened 00,000 babies delivered at University Hospital , Uppsala , between 0000 and 0000 . 

Four of the mothers had measles while pregnant . 

" Three of the four children had Crohn 's disease , " Wakefield 's group wrote in the Lancet medical journal . 

Crohn 's is an inflammation of the bowel that can sometimes require surgery . 

It causes diarrhoea , abdominal pain and weight loss . 

The researchers said the three children involved had especially severe cases . 

Exposure to viruses can often cause birth defects . 

Most notably , women who get rubella ( German measles ) have a high risk of a stillborn baby .

<OOV> pills do n't lower cholesterol , study finds . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

<OOV> pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed , British researchers have reported . 

A study by a team of doctors at Oxford University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets . 

The study involved 000 people with high blood cholesterol levels . 

They were given 000 milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets . " 

There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo , " they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians . 

Those taking part were told to eat a low-fat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills , and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the six-week period . 

The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate . 

Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol . 

But the Oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly , those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short . 

The six-month trial was funded by the British Heart Foundation and <OOV> Pharma GmbH , which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets . 

The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol .

Britain gives aid to <OOV> Caribbean island . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

Britain said on Thursday it would give 00 million pounds ( $ 00 million ) of development aid to the Caribbean island of Montserrat , where much of the population living in the south has fled to avoid a volcano . 

The volcano in the Soufriere hills has erupted three times in the past 00 months and last April some 0,000 people living in the capital , Plymouth , and southern areas were evacuated to the north , where many are living in public shelters and schools . 

" This assistance will provide a fast track development programme for the designated ( northern ) safe area , " Britain 's Overseas Development Administration said in a statement . 

Britain gave 0.0 million pounds ( $ 00 million ) to Montserrat , which is one of its dependent territories , when the volcano first became active . 

Overseas Development Minister Lynda Chalker said a recent census had shown most <OOV> wanted to remain on the island . " 

The development of the north will help them to do just that , " she said . 

Tennis - Philippoussis looms for Sampras in U.S. Open . 

Bill <OOV> 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

World number one Pete Sampras , seeking his first Grand Slam title of the year , and women 's top seed Steffi Graf , aiming for her third , should be able to ease into the year 's final major , which begins on Monday . 

Sampras opens the defence of his U.S. Open crown against David Rikl of the Czech Republic , while top-ranked Graf begins her title defence against Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia . 

Wednesday 's U.S. Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round . 

Looming in Sampras 's future is a likely third-round date with recent nemesis Mark Philippoussis , the rising Australian who took out Sampras in the third round of the Australian Open in January . 

Sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 00-year-old power hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some first-week fireworks . 

While only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 00th-ranked veteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus . 

There will be no repeat of last year 's men 's final with eighth-ranked Andre Agassi landing in Sampras 's half of the draw . 

<OOV> Agassi up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into Sampras as early as the quarter-finals , but they could lock horns in the semis . 

Olympic champion Agassi meets Karim Alami of Morocco in the first round . 

Surprise second seed Michael Chang , ranked third in the world , opens against Czech Daniel Vacek , while women 's second seed Monica Seles drew American Anne Miller as her first victim . 

Second-ranked Austrian Thomas Muster , who was seeded third , did not have the luck of the draw with him . 

In the first round Muster faces American Richey Reneberg , who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late . 

If he survives , Muster is seeded to run into either fifth-seeded Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands or <OOV> American Todd Martin in the quarter-finals in Chang 's half of the draw . 

Perhaps the best , yet most unfortunate , first-round matchup of the men 's competition pits eighth seed Jim Courier against retiring star Stefan Edberg . 

The popular Swede is playing his final major tournament next week and the two-time champion 's Grand Slam farewell could well be a one-match affair . 

With the exception of a Philippoussis showdown , Sampras looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of Frenchman Cedric Pioline and ailing French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov , who is nursing a rib injury , in his path . 

Seles , runner-up to Graf last year , is seeded to run into fifth-ranked German Anke Huber in the quarter-finals with fourth seed Conchita Martinez or eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport looking like her most likely semifinal opponents . 

But Huber will be tested immediately with a first-round encounter against dangerous 00th-ranked South African Amanda Coetzer . 

Sanchez Vicario , runner-up to Graf at the French Open and Wimbledon , begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent Martina Hingis , the 00th seed , before a probable quarter-final clash with seventh-seeded veteran Jana Novotna . 

Martinez begins play against Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania .

RTRS - Tennis - Muster upset , Philippoussis wins , Stoltenberg loses . 

TORONTO 0000-00-00 

Top-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria was beaten 0-0 0-0 by <OOV> Daniel Nestor of Canada on Wednesday in his first match of the $ 0 million Canadian Open . 

A lefthander with a strong serve , Nestor kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the second-round match against Muster , playing his first match after receiving a first-round bye along with the other top eight seeds . 

The tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia was beaten <OOV> ) 0-0 0-0 by unseeded Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden . 

Other seeded players advancing were number three Wayne Ferreira of South Africa , number four Marcelo Rios of Chile , number six MaliVai Washington of the United States and American Todd Martin , the seventh <OOV> . 

Eighth seed Marc Rosset of Switzerland was eliminated in a one hour , 00 minute battle by unseeded Mark Philippoussis of Australia . 

Philippoussis saved a match point at 0-0 in the third-set tie break before winning 0-0 0-0 0-0 ( 0-0 ) . 

Philippoussis 's compatriot , 00th seed Jason Stoltenberg , was not as fortunate . 

He held one match point at 0-0 in a marathon third-set tie break but was beaten 0-0 0-0 ( 0-0 ) 0-0 ( 00-00 ) by unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic . 

" I knew I had to serve well and keep the points short and that 's what I was able to do , " said Nestor , who ranks 00th in doubles . 

There were only two service breaks in the match . 

The lanky Canadian broke Muster at 0-0 in the first set and 0-0 in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the Austrian hit a service return long . 

" I probably did n't hit five ground strokes in the whole match , " said Muster , only partly joking . " 

The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I did n't really get my timing playing from the baseline . " 

" He played a good match , took a few chances , and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve . " 

Playing at night was not Muster 's preference . " 

I asked for a day match and they gave me a night match , " he said . " 

I do n't like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference . " 

Ivanisevic rallied from a 0-0 deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the 00th-ranked Tillstrom , who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot Stefan Edberg in the second round at Wimbledon . 

Ivanisevic hit 00 aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 00-year-old Tillstrom . 

The sixth-ranked Ivanisevic , who lost in the final at Indianapolis to world number one Pete Sampras of the U.S. last Sunday , made a quick getaway after his loss but did say : " Something was not there when I arrived ( in Toronto ) . 

I did n't feel good . 

And I did n't have a good feeling as soon as I lost in my doubles ( on Tuesday ) . " 

" I thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes , " said Tillstrom . 

The 00-year-old Philippoussis , who beat Sampras in the third round of this year 's Australian Open , stayed calm in a nervy third-set tie break against Rosset . 

" I 'm pleased because I did n't play that great today , but I fought really well , " he said . " 

When I was down 0-0 in the tiebreak ( in the third set ) , I just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight . 

Then he shanked a forehand at to make it <OOV> and that helped me back . "

Nigerian general takes over Liberia ECOMOG force . 

MONROVIA 0000-00-00 

Nigerian Major General Sam Victor Malu took over on Thursday as commander of the ECOMOG peacekeeping force in Liberia , two days after the start of the latest ceasefire in the six-year civil war . 

Malu replaced another Nigerian major general , John Inienger , who told officers at the handover ceremony that peace was now at hand for Liberia after six years of fighting and more than a dozen failed accords . 

" The search for peace in Liberia has been difficult , challenging and sometimes painful . 

Peacekeepers were harassed , killed and taken hostage , " he said . 

" It is difficult but I want to assure you that peace is in sight . " 

United Nations military observers travelling to the western town of Tubmanburg on Wednesday to monitor the ceasefire were delayed by shooting along the highway , U.N. special representative Anthony Nyakyi said . 

They finally went ahead with an escort from the ULIMO-J faction . 

Faction leaders who agreed a new peace deal in the Nigerian capital Abuja on Saturday have accused each other of breaking the ceasefire . 

The latest peace deal foresees the disarmament of an estimated 00,000 combatants and sets a target date of May 00 next year for elections . 

The ECOMOG force , currently 00,000 strong , was sent to Liberia by the Economic Community of West African States in 0000 at the height of the fighting . 

Guinea calls two days of prayer . 

CONAKRY 0000-00-00 

The West African state of Guinea declared Thursday and Friday days of national prayer . 

A government statement , broadcast repeatedly by state radio , said the two days of prayer were " for the dead , for peace and prosperity in Guinea , the victory of the new government and the health of the head of state " . 

The precise reason for the call was not immediately clear . 

Guinea 's president , Lansana Conte , vice-president of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference , left for Kuwait on August 00 to prepare the next OIC summit in Pakistan in 0000 . 

Koranic reading sessions and prayers were to be held in the farming town of <OOV> , near his home about 00 km ( 00 miles ) from the capital Conakry . 

Conte , an army general , survived a February army pay revolt which at the time he described as a veiled attempt to topple him . 

He has since named a prime minister for the first time since early in his rule and ordered a crackdown on corruption . 

Conte seized power in 0000 after the death of veteran Marxist leader Ahmed Sekou Toure . 

He won elections in 0000 .

LIMA , Peru 0000-00-00 

Peruvian guerrillas killed one man and took eight people hostage after taking over a village in the country 's northeastern jungle region , <OOV> terrorist police sources said on Wednesday . 

For three hours on Tuesday , around 000 members of the Maoist rebel group Shining Path took control of <OOV> Robles , a small village about 000 miles ( 000 km ) northeast of Lima , the sources said .

Former Surinam rebel leader held after shooting . 

PARAMARIBO , Surinam 0000-00-00 

Flamboyant former Surinamese rebel leader Ronny Brunswijk was in custody on Wednesday charged with attempted murder , police said . 

Brunswijk turned himself into police after Freddy Pinas , a <OOV> visitor from the Netherlands , accused Brunswijk of trying to kill him on Sunday after a bar-room brawl in the small mining town of <OOV> , about 00 miles ( 00 km ) east of Paramaribo , said police spokesman Ro <OOV> . 

Pinas , showing cuts and bruises on his face , told reporters the former head of the feared Jungle Command had tried and failed to shoot him after Pinas objected to Brunswijk 's advances toward his wife . 

Pinas said Brunswijk then ordered his bodyguards to beat him up . 

Brunswijk , 00 , denied the charges and said he had merely defended himself when Pinas attacked him with a bottle . 

It was the second time Brunswijk had been charged with attempted murder in less than two years .

Police went to the house after receiving complaints of sawing during the night over the course of several days . 

When they arrived to investigate , police saw people escaping from the back door so they decided to search the house .

Australia foreign minister arrives in China . 

BEIJING 0000-00-00 

Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer arrived in Beijing on Thursday for a four-day visit that follows rising friction between the two nations in recent weeks . 

Downer was to meet Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and sign an agreement on an Australian consulate in Hong Kong , an official of the Australian embassy in Beijing said . 

China will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong , a British colony , in <OOV> . 

Relations between China and Australia have been strained in recent weeks because of Australia 's plan to sell uranium to China 's rival Taiwan . 

Other issues affecting ties include plans by an Australian cabinet minister to visit Taiwan , a security pact between Canberra and Washington and a possible visit to Australia next month by Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama . 

Downer is the first Australian minister to visit China since the new conservative government took office in Canberra in March . 

Palestinians accuse PA of banning books . 

NABLUS , West Bank 0000-00-00 

A West Bank bookseller charged on Thursday that the Palestinian Information Ministry has forced him to sign an undertaking not to distribute books written by critics of Israeli-PLO self-rule deals . 

" They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action . 

One official told me ' you have to either destroy the books or return them to Amman ' , " Daoud <OOV> , owner of the Nablus-based <OOV> bookshop , told Reuters . 

He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from Jordan of a book by Edward Said , a prominent scholar at New York City 's Columbia University . 

Said , a U.S. citizen of Palestinian origin , has been an outspoken critic of the 0000 Israeli-PLO self-rule deal and has written at least two books on the accord . 

On Wednesday a bookseller in the West Bank town of Ramallah said police about a month ago confiscated several copies of two of Said 's books on the Israel-PLO self-rule deals . 

Palestinian Information Ministry Director-General Mutawakel Taha denied that ministry officials forced anyone to sign any undertaking and insisted that the Palestinian Authority has no plans to censor books . 

" There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever , " Taha told Reuters . 

But Taha said that the absence of relevent legislations may have resulted in some mistakes by some security officials . 

" This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers , " he said . 

Daoud said books by other authors , including British Journalist Patrick Seale , were also banned . 

He said that security officials often visit his shop to make sure he was not selling the books . 

" I think this is a bad beginning . 

If we have confidence , why should we be afraid of the other opinion ? " 

Daoud said . 

Thousands of books were banned from sale in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by the Israeli military authorities before the Jewish state handed over parts of the two areas to the PLO under a self-rule deal in 0000 . 

Egypt blames Istanbul control tower for accident . 

CAIRO 0000-00-00 

The chairman of national carrier EgyptAir on Thursday blamed the control tower at Istanbul airport for the EgyptAir plane accident . 

Twenty people were injured on Wednesday when the EgyptAir Boeing 000 overshot the runway , caught fire , hit a taxi and skipped across a road onto a railway line . 

Chairman Mohamed Fahim Rayyan told a news conference at Cairo airport : " The control tower should have allocated the plane another runway , instead of the one the plane landed on . " 

" The one it landed on is 0,000 metres ( 0,000 yards ) long while the other one if more than 0,000 metres ( 0,000 yards ) long and is less steep , " he added . 

He said a Turkish civil aviation authority official had made the same point and he noted that a Turkish plane had a similar accident there in 0000 . 

The EgyptAir pilot blamed Turkish airport staff for misleading him . 

The landing took place after a rainstorm . 

" Its not an accident . 

It 's very wet . 

The brake action is very poor and the tower said it 's medium . 

That 's wrong , " the pilot told private <OOV> news agency in English . 

Egypt wants nothing to do with Sudanese rulers . 

CAIRO 0000-00-00 

The Egyptian government will have nothing more to do with the Sudanese government because it continues to shelter and support Egyptian militants , President Hosni Mubarak said in a speech on Thursday . 

Egypt says the Sudanese government helped the Moslem militants who tried to kill Mubarak in Addis Ababa last year . 

It sponsored last week 's U.N. Security Council resolution threatening a ban on Sudanese flights abroad if Khartoum does not hand over three men accused in the Addis Ababa incident . 

The sanctions will come into effect in November if Sudan fails to extradite the men , but Sudan says it cannot hand them over to Ethiopia for trial because they are not in Sudan . 

" We are still eager that nothing should affect the Sudanese people but we will not deal with the current regime or the Turabi front or whatever , " Mubarak told a group of academics . 

Hassan al-Turabi is the leader of the National Islamic Front , the political force behind the Sudanese government . 

" I do n't want to go into more details than that but there are more details and they are bitter . 

There are terrorists they are sheltering and they make Sudanese <OOV> for them and they get paid by them , " Mubarak said . 

He did not say if Egypt would go so far as to break relations , a step it has been reluctant to take , ostensibly because it would affect ordinary Sudanese .

Miss Universe hides behind veil of silence .

LAS <OOV> , N.M. 0000-00-00 

Miss Universe , Venezuela 's Alicia Machado , left New Mexico on Thursday , refusing to answer questions about her weight or claims she was told to either go on a crash diet or give up her title . 

Machado , 00 , flew to Los Angeles after slipping away from the New Mexico desert town of Las <OOV> , where she attended the 0000 Miss Teen USA pageant on Wednesday . 

While Machado was not a contestant here , she came under intense scrutiny following reports she was given an ultimatum by Los Angeles-based Miss Universe Inc. to drop 00 pounds ( 00 kg ) in two weeks or risk losing her crown . 

In Venezuela , her mother told Reuters that Machado had a swollen face when she left home two weeks ago because she had her wisdom teeth extracted . 

Marta Fajardo insisted her daughter , who weighed 000 pounds ( 00 kg ) when she won the Miss Universe title in Las Vegas in May , had perfectly normal eating habits . 

" Everybody has their own addiction to something or other but it 's not as if she eats cakes like crazy , " she said . 

Organisers flatly denied ever threatening Machado but immediately put her under wraps and blocked access to her . 

Dressed in a black strapless evening gown at Wednesday 's pageant , Machado was clearly heavier than the contestants but still won rave reviews after her brief appearance on stage . 

" Are you kidding ? 

She 's fantastic , " said Nikki Campbell , 00 , who went to the pageant . " 

She looked great . 

Very sexy . " 

Machado 's publicists said on Thursday she was scheduled to stay in Los Angeles for promotional work with sponsors before returning to Venezuela on Sept . 

0 . 

Beauty queens are high-profile personalities in Venezuela and Machado 's alleged weight problem made front page news this week . 

It was an official of the Miss Venezuela Organisation who first said Machado had been told to lose weight fast . 

People close to her said she then eased up on her diet and indulged her passion for pasta and cake , but it was not clear how many pounds she gained and most people who saw her said she was still a long way from being fat . 

Martin Brooks , president of Miss Universe Inc , said he spoke with Machado to assure her that organisers were not putting pressure on her . 

" She 's fine with it . 

She wished , as we all did , that it had n't happened but she 's spiritually and mentally terrific . 

There 's no problem whatsoever , " he told Reuters . 

He said the lifestyle associated with being Miss Universe could make routine exercise difficult . 

" The problem is they travel so much and are so busy that the ability to have any type of regimented routine workout does n't exist . 

I dont know if Alicia is working out . 

We have n't talked about it because it has n't been an issue , " he said .

Defiant U.S. neo-Nazi jailed by German court . 

Andrew Gray 

HAMBURG , Germany 0000-00-00 

A Hamburg court sentenced U.S. neo-Nazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States . 

Lauck , from Lincoln , Nebraska , yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred . 

" The struggle will go on , " the 00-year-old shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards . 

Lauck 's lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court 's decision , arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law . 

The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neo-Nazism . 

Lauck 's worldwide network has been the main source of anti-Semitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 0000s . 

" Lauck possessed a well-oiled propaganda machine , honed during more than 00 years , " presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court . 

" He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany . " 

said Bertram , who also read out extracts from Lauck 's material praising Hitler as " the greatest of all leaders " and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth . 

Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial , prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since 0000 . 

He had demanded a five-year jail term but said he was satisfied with the court 's sentence . 

Publishing and distributing neo-Nazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck 's defence team had argued that U.S freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his <OOV> books , magazines , videos and flags in his homeland . 

Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he " welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neo-Nazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications " . 

" It is high time he was behind bars , " the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement . 

Lauck , dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark <OOV> black moustache , showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court 's decision . 

But as Lauck was about to be led away , he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quick-fire diatribe against the court . 

" Neither the National Socialists ( Nazis ) nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen , " he shouted , in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark . " 

That 's the truth . " 

His attorney , Hans-Otto Sieg , told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States . 

Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers ' Party Foreign Organisation ( NSDAP-AO ) , which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler 's Nazi party . 

During the three-month trial , the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAP-AO 's " NS Kampfruf " ( " National Socialist Battle Cry " ) magazine , filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews . 

The court rejected Sieg 's argument that Lauck 's extradition from Denmark , where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities , was illegal . 

Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anti-constitutional organisations . 

He will probably be free in around two and a half years . 

The court ruled that the 00 months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term . 

UN official says Iraqi deal will occur " soon " . 

UNITED NATIONS 0000-00-00

" I am reluctant to speculate but we are doing the preparations and the secretary-general is anxious to start the program , " said <OOV> Yasushi Akashi . 

" It might be sooner than you think , " he told reporters after briefing the Security Council on arrangements for monitors needed to carry out the agreement .

Suspected killers of bishop dead -- Algeria TV . 

PARIS 0000-00-00 

Algerian security forces have shot dead three Moslem guerrillas suspected of killing a leading French bishop in western Algeria , the Algerian state-run television said on Thursday . 

Security forces also arrested four other men sought for giving support to the slain Moslem rebels , the television said . 

The television , which did not say when the security forces killed the rebels , said the four arrested men confessed details of the assassination of the French Roman Catholic Bishop Pierre Claverie . 

The 00-year-old Claverie was killed in August 0 in a bomb blast at his residence in the western Algerian city of Oran , hours after he met visiting French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette in Algiers . 

An estimated 00,000 Algerians and more than 000 foreigners have been killed in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against the Algerian government forces since early 0000 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists took a commanding lead .

Clinton 's Ballybunion fans invited to Chicago . 

DUBLIN 0000-00-00 

U.S. President Bill Clinton had to drop the resort of Ballybunion from a whirlwind Irish tour last year . 

So Ballybunion is going to America instead . 

Two residents of the Atlantic resort , where Clinton was to have played golf with the Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring , have been invited to the Democratic party convention in Chicago on August 00-00 . 

They have been asked to bring with them the placards they waved when Clinton addressed Ireland at a packed ceremony in Dublin city centre on December 0 , last year . 

They read : " Ballybunion backs Clinton . " 

" The Democratic party have requested we bring our placards with us . 

We will be guests of the Kennedys , " said Frank <OOV> , one of the two who have been invited to Chicago . 

Clinton made a triumphant Irish tour to back a Northern Ireland peace process but was forced to drop Ballybunion from a packed schedule at the last minute . 

Bonn says Moscow has promised to observe ceasefire . 

BONN 0000-00-00 

Germany said on Thursday it had received assurances from the Russian government that its forces would observe the latest ceasefire in Chechnya . 

Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said top Bonn diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger had been assured by senior Russian officials that the ultimatum to storm and take the Chechen capital of Grozny was not valid . 

" The Russian side confirmed that the ceasefire is in place and they will keep to it , " Erdmann told Reuters after speaking by telephone to Ischinger , who had met the officials on a two-day visit to Moscow . 

He returned to Bonn on Thursday . 

Ischinger is the political director of Bonn 's foreign ministry . 

Ischinger said he met three Russian deputy foreign ministers and a vice defence minister , who confirmed Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov 's pledge that Moscow would seek a political solution under the aegis of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 

" The ultimatum ( to storm Grozny ) is no longer an issue , " he said quoting Ischinger , who had been sent to Moscow by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel as his personal envoy to urge an end to Moscow 's military campaign in the breakaway region . 

Ischinger said the threat of a major assault to take Grozny had been the unauthorised initiative of the commanding general and not Moscow 's intention . 

The officials had been positive about Kinkel 's request on Wednesday that President Boris Yeltsin 's security chief Alexander Lebed should , on his return to Moscow , meet Tim <OOV> , the OSCE representative responsible for Chechnya , he said . 

India says sees no arms race with China , Pakistan . 

NEW DELHI 0000-00-00 

India said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean New Delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring Pakistan and China . 

Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral was asked at a news conference if India 's decision to block adoption of the accord in Geneva would lead to an arms race with Pakistan and China . 

" I do n't see that possibility because India is not entering into any arms race , " he said . " 

Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons , particularly nuclear . " 

China , along with Britain , France , Russia and the United States , is a declared nuclear power . 

India carried out a nuclear test in 0000 but says it has not built the bomb . 

Experts believe both India and Pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons . 

Gujral said he did not expect India 's veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) to damage bilateral ties with other nations . 

" I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country . 

The text has already been blocked , " he said . 

Gujral said India would re-examine its position if the treaty , particularly a clause providing for its entry into force , was modified . 

Asked what India would do if the pact were forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly , Gujral said : " That bridge I will cross when I come to it . " 

In a written statement released at the news conference , Gujral reiterated India 's objections to the treaty , under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva . 

" It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony , " the statement said . 

Gujral said India had national security concerns that made it impossible for New Delhi to sign the CTBT . 

" Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option , " he said , adding that India had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country 's lone test blast in 0000 . 

He said : " We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security " . 

Britain says death of its citizen will sour ties . 

DHAKA 0000-00-00 

A British minister expressed his government 's official disquiet on Thursday at the recent death of a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin at Dhaka airport . 

" I have told Bangladesh leaders that British goverment has attached serious importance to the resolution of the tragic death of Siraj Mia , " Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Liam Fox Fox , told reporters . 

Siraj Mia died at Dhaka airport on May 0 during interogation by customs officials after arriving from London . 

His body bore multiple injuries , and his relatives complained that he was murdered . 

A post-mortem report suggested he might have been tortured . 

But customs authorities said the passenger was drunk and died of loss of blood from a deep cut in his wrist after he hit a glass sheet . 

Fox , who arrived in Bangladesh on Tuesday on four-day visit , said Britain wanted Dhaka to act seriously on the case . 

" This is one of the reasons of my visit here ... 

this is an important issue in our relationship " , said Fox , who is due to leave for Nepal on Friday . 

Fox said the incident had strained relations between the two governments . 

He said the Mia 's issue had been raised in the House of Commons . 

Fox said he had brought up the issue at every meeting he had had with government leaders in Dhaka . 

He said the Bangladesh government had assured him it was taking the matter seriously . 

" The British government wants a thorough investigation and a just outcome , " he said . 

Fox said the British government wanted an end to the alleged harassment of its nationals at Dhaka airport by customs officials . 

Bangladesh 's Criminal Investigation Department has charged two immigration officials in connection with Mia 's killing . 

Mia , a father of five children , had a restaurant business in a London suburb . 

India fears attempts to disrupt Kashmir polls . 

SRINAGAR , India 0000-00-00 

India 's Home ( interior ) Minister accused Pakistan on on Thursday of planning to disrupt state elections in troubled Jammu and Kashmir state . 

" It seems that from across the border there is going to be a planned attempt to disrupt the elections , " Inderjit Gupta told reporters in the state capital Srinagar . 

The local polls next month will be the first since 0000 in the state , clamped under direct rule from New Delhi since 0000 . 

India has often accused Pakistan of abetting militancy in the valley , a charge Islamabad has always denied . 

Gupta said there might be an increase in the number of people infiltrating the Kashmir valley to create disturbance in the region . 

" We noticed among the people who come from across the border , there is a growing number of foreign mercenaries , " Gupta said . 

India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the troubled region of Kashmir since independence from Britain in 0000 . 

Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda 's centre-left government hopes the elections will help restore normality and democratic rule in Jammu and Kashmir , where more than 00,000 people have died in <OOV> violence since 0000 . 

Over a dozen militant groups are fighting New Delhi 's rule in the state .

India RBI chief sees cut in cash reserve ratio . 

NEW DELHI 0000-00-00 

The Reserve bank of India governor C. Rangarajan said on Thursday that he expected the cash reserve ratio ( CRR ) maintained by banks to be reduced over the medium term . 

" Over the medium term , yes , " he told Reuters after addressing industrialists in the capital . 

He denied having said in a recent newspaper interview that the CRR could be raised if necessary . 

He said he was only trying ( in that newspaper report ) to explain the theoretical position on the use of the CRR by central banks to manage money supply . 

Rangarajan explained that the cash reserve ratio was an instrument that central banks could use to regulate money supply by reducing or increasing the ratio . 

But in the current context , the government stood by an earlier commitment to reduce it over a period of time , he said in response to a question .

Two pct India current account deficit viable - RBI . 

BOMBAY 0000-00-00 

The Reserve Bank of India Governor Chakravarty Rangarajan said on Thursday that a current account deficit of two percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) was sustainable given the currrent rate of growth . 

" The current account deficit of around two percent of GDP is a sustainable level of deficit given the expected real growth rate and the trends in imports and exports , " Rangarajan said in an address to business leaders in New Delhi . 

Rangarajan said a current account deficit of two percent brought about by a 00-00 percent annual growth in exports and a 00-00 percent rise in imports along with an increase in non-debt flows could lead to a reduction in the debt-service ratio to below 00 percent over the next five years .

Mother Teresa devoted to world 's poor . 

CALCUTTA 0000-00-00 

Mother Teresa , known as the Saint of the Gutters , won the Nobel Peace Prize in 0000 for bringing hope and dignity to millions of poor , unwanted people with her simple message : " The poor must know that we love them . " 

While the world heaps honours on her and even regards her as a living saint , the nun of Albanian descent maintains she is merely doing God 's work . 

" It gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected , " she said . " 

The poor do not need our sympathy and pity . 

They need our love and compassion . " 

The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary was on respiratory support in intensive care in an Indian nursing home on Thursday after suffering heart failure . 

But an attending doctor said Mother Teresa , who turns 00 next Tuesday , was conscious and in stable condition . 

The task Mother Teresa began alone in 0000 in the slums of densely-populated Calcutta , and grew to touch the hearts of people around the world . 

When in 0000 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize , she said characteristically : " I am unworthy . " 

The world disagreed , showering more than 00 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna , or Jewel of India , the country 's highest civilian award . 

Her health began to deteriorate in 0000 when she was fitted with a heart pacemaker . 

A year later , the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order . 

More than 000 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor . 

They could not agree , so asked her to stay on . 

She agreed . 

In 0000 , Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia . 

In 0000 , she fell in Rome and broke three ribs . 

In August the same year , while in New Delhi to receive yet another award , she developed malaria , complicated by her heart and lung problems . 

Last April she fractured her left collar bone . 

But her increasing frailty , arthritis and failing eyesight has not stopped her travels around the world to mingle with the poor and desperate . 

Mother Teresa was born Agnes <OOV> <OOV> to Albanian parents in Skopje , in what was then Serbia , on August 00 , 0000 . 

She attended a government school and was already deeply religious by the time she was 00 . 

At the age of 00 she became a <OOV> nun , hoping to work at the Order 's Calcutta mission . 

She was sent to <OOV> Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her <OOV> and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta . 

She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September , 0000 . " 

The message was quite clear , " she told one interviewer . " 

I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them . 

It was an order . 

I knew where I belonged . " 

The Vatican and the mother superior in Dublin approved and after intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December 0000 . 

She took the name of Teresa , after France 's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus . 

In India she was simply called Mother . 

Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital . 

Named " Nirmal <OOV> " ( Tender Heart ) , it was the first of a chain of 000 homes for dying , destitute people , admitting nearly 00,000 a year . 

Her Missionaries of Charity , a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 0000 , now runs about 000 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad . 

In 0000 a British television documentary called the myth around Mother Teresa a mixture of " hyperbole and credulity " . 

Catholics around the world rose to her defence . 

RTRS - <OOV> forecasts <OOV> profit boost . 

Bernard Hickey 

SYDNEY 0000-00-00 

Media baron Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp Ltd reported lower than expected 0000/00 profits on Thursday , but forecast that the hit film " Independence Day " would help increase profits by at least 00 percent in 0000/00 . 

" From an earnings perspective , the current fiscal year has begun with great promise due to the hit motion picture ' Independence Day , ' " News Corp said in a statement announcing its results for the year to June 00 , 0000 . 

It said moderating paper prices and solid orders for advertising at its Fox Broadcasting television network in the United States would also help boost profits in the 0000/00 year . " 

A budgeted profit increase of at least 00 percent for the full year currently appears very attainable , " News Corp said . 

The bullish comments for the coming year soothed analysts and most shareholders , who were disappointed by the lower than expected profit for 0000/00 . 

News announced pre-abnormals net profit for the year fell six percent to A$ 0.00 billion ( US$ 000 million ) and earnings per share dropped to 00 cents from 00 cents . 

Analysts had on average expected a pre-abnormals profit of A$ 0.000 billion . 

" The year just gone was disappointing , but the outlook for the current year looks good , " First Pacific media analyst Lachlan Drummond said . 

News Corp said strong performances in U.S. television and British newspapers were offset by lower profits from News Corp 's magazine and publishing divisions and further hefty losses from its Asian Star TV operations . 

Higher newsprint prices hit profits hard . " 

Throughout the group , higher paper prices increased costs by over US$ 000 million , " it said . 

News Corp said British newspaper operating profits rose 00 percent for the year , as higher cover prices at The Sun and The Times and higher advertising volumes offset increased newsprint costs . 

Advertising revenues at The Times grew 00 percent . 

Analysts said sharply lower earnings from News Corp 's book publishing division and its U.S. magazines had been the major surprises in the results for 0000/00 . 

News Corp said revenue gains at its magazines and inserts division were offset by higher paper prices and lower sales at the U.S. TV Guide . 

News said dramatically lower earnings from the British arm of its <OOV> publishing division more than offset healthy results from its U.S. operation . 

It said the demise of the Net Book Agreement had hurt the British operations , and weak performances from the San Francisco unit of <OOV> had not helped . 

The minimum price setting expired last September when three publishers pulled out . 

But it was the bullish profit forecast for 0000/00 that took the spotlight in the market , with some analysts saying 00 percent may even be an understatement . 

" If they 're saying at least 00 percent , then their internal forecasts are probably saying 00 or 00 percent , " said one Sydney media analyst who declined to be named . 

News Corp 's shares were down eight cents at A$ 0.00 at 0.00 p.m. ( 0000 GMT ) in a soft market .

RTRS - Budget cuts to boost Australia savings - RBA . 

CANBERRA 0000-00-00 

The Australian government 's plans to slash its budget deficit should make a useful contribution to national savings , the Reserve Bank of Australia ( RBA ) said in its annual report . 

" The government 's announced plans to balance the budget , if realised , would make a useful contribution to raising national savings , " the RBA said . 

The bank said there were concerns fiscal consolidation would unduly restrict growth , but evidence was ambiguous . 

In its 0000/00 budget announced on Tuesday , the Australian Coalition government announced an underlying budget deficit of A$ 0.00 billion , and pledged to return the underlying budget balance to surplus by 0000/00 . 

The budget deficit was A$ 00.0 billion in 0000/00 . 

-- Sydney Newsroom 00-0 0000-0000 

" Determined and credible efforts to rein in unsustainable fiscal positions ( are ) often rewarded by rising confidence , giving favourable effects on economic activity even in the short term , " it said . 

" More generally , the long-term effects of fiscal consolidation are clearly positive , with higher saving tending to promote economic growth by raising investment and lowering long-term real interest rates , " the RBA said .

Ukraine hails peace as marks five-year independence . 

Rostislav <OOV> 

KIEV 0000-00-00 

Ukraine celebrates five years of independence from Kremlin rule on Saturday , hailing civil and inter-ethnic peace as its main post-Soviet achievement . 

Ukraine 's declaration of independence in 0000 , backed <OOV> by a referendum in December of that year , effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from Moscow . 

Ukraine , with a Russian community of 00 million people -- the world 's largest outside Russia -- has avoided conflicts like those in Russia 's Chechnya , neighbouring Moldova , and the former Soviet republics of Georgia , Azerbaijan and Tajikistan . 

" Ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , " President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week . 

" Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . " 

But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround . 

Inflation -- a <OOV> 00,000 percent a year in 0000 -- was a respectable 0.0 percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow . 

Kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the Ukraina Palace on Friday that " there was a turning point " in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future . 

" There is no doubt that economic growth has already started , " said <OOV> <OOV> , head of the International Monetary Fund 's mission in Ukraine . " 

The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts . " 

Central bank officials said on Thursday that a <OOV> hryvna currency would " definitely " be introduced before the end of this year . 

It will replace the interim karbovanets currency , which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in 0000 but now trades at almost 00 karbovanets per rouble . 

Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems . 

Proud of its record in promptly joining both the Council of Europe and NATO 's Partnership for Peace , Ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week , offending China by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public , if unofficial visit . 

China cancelled a visit by a top-level delegation in protest . 

Kiev 's Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said Beijing was overreacting . 

But Ukraine , seeing itself as a bridge between Russia and the rapidly <OOV> countries of eastern Europe , is looking West as well as East . 

" The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage Ukraine 's interests in post-Soviet areas . 

Relations with Russia , which is our main partner , have great importance , " Kuchma said . 

" But Ukraine cannot be economically oriented on Russia , even though those in some circles push us to do that . " 

Kuchma has said Kiev wants membership of the European Union , associate membership of the Western European Union defence grouping and to move closer to NATO . 

A message from the West this week from U.S. President Bill Clinton congratulated Ukraine on the anniversary , promising to support market reforms and praising Ukraine as a " stabilising factor " in a united Europe . 

Oldest Albania book disappears from Vatican - paper . 

TIRANA 0000-00-00 

A <OOV> document , the earliest complete example of written Albanian , has disappeared from the Vatican archives , an Albanian newspaper said on Friday . 

Gazeta <OOV> said the " Book of Mass ' , by <OOV> <OOV> , dating from 0000 and discovered in 0000 in a religious seminary in Rome , was the first major document published in the Albanian language . 

" We Albanians , sons of <OOV> , believed our language had a written document but now we do not have it any more , " lamented scholar Musa <OOV> , told of the loss by the Vatican library . 

Tirana 's national library has three copies of the " Book of Mass ' . " 

There is nothing left for us but to be grateful to civilisation for inventing photocopies , " Gazeta <OOV> said . 

Russia to clamp down on barter deals . 

MOSCOW 0000-00-00 

Russian officials , keen to cut capital flight , will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum , a customs official said on Friday . 

" We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries , viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia , " Marina Volkova , deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee , told Reuters . 

Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals , with nothing imported in return . 

She said the cost of such <OOV> goods was $ 0.00 billion in 0000 . 

Barter deals were worth $ 0.0 billion last year , or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 00.0 billion , she said . 

" The cost of exported goods is too often understated , so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of <OOV> goods may be even higher , " Volkova said . 

A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals , and Volkova said this " could substantially improve the situation " . 

In line with the decree , which will come into force on November 0 , all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within 000 days . 

" If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " Volkova said . 

<OOV> the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but Volkova said the authorities are currently " tackling the technicalities of the issue " . 

Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade , but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 0000-0000 has given barter a new impetus . 

A few years ago , barter deals accounted for up to 00-00 percent of Russian exports because " thousands ( of ) trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems " , Volkova said . 

" Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones . 

But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high , " she said .

Viacom plans " Mission " sequel - report . 

LOS ANGELES 0000-00-00 

Paramount Pictures is going ahead with a sequel to the Tom Cruise blockbuster , " Mission : Impossible " and hopes to release it in the summer of 0000 , Daily Variety reported in its Friday edition . 

The big-screen version of the spy TV series has grossed $ 000 million domestically since opening May 00 , and $ 000 million overseas so far . 

It 's the biggest success for Viacom <OOV> Paramount since 0000 's " Forrest Gump " . 

However , many critics complained its plot was incomprehensible . 

Cruise will reprise his roles as star and co-producer , and will soon meet Academy Award-winning screenwriter William Goldman , who will write the script , the report said . 

It said " Mission : Impossible " director Brian De Palma would have first crack at the sequel , though no deals have been made yet . 

Goldman , whose Oscars were for " Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid " and " All the President 's Men " , earlier this summer criticised some of the season 's blockbusters . 

However , he singled out " Mission : Impossible " as an especially entertaining movie , Daily Variety said .

LONDON 0000-00-00 

England batsman John Crawley was forced to endure a frustrating delay of over three hours before resuming his quest for a maiden test century in the third test against Pakistan on Friday . 

Heavy overnight rain and morning drizzle ruled out any play before lunch on the second day but an improvement in the weather prompted the umpires to announce a 0000 local time ( 0000 GMT ) start in the event of no further rain . 

Crawley , unbeaten on 00 overnight in an England total of 000 for six , was spotted strumming a guitar in the dressing-room as the Oval ground staff took centre stage . 

There were several damp patches on the square and the outfield and it was still raining when the players took an early lunch at 0000 local time ( 0000 GMT ) . 

When brighter weather finally arrived , the umpires announced a revised figure of 00 overs to be bowled with play extended to at least 0000 local time ( 0000 GMT ) .

LONDON 0000-00-00 

Middlesbrough 's Italian striker Fabrizio Ravanelli is to wear his team sponsor 's name on the inside of his shirt so it can be seen when he scores . 

Every time he finds the net , the grey-haired forward pulls his <OOV> over his head as he runs to salute the fans , and Middlesbrough 's sponsors want to cash in on the spectacle . 

" Having seen Ravanelli celebrate his goals ... 

we thought it would be fun to have ( the name ) on the inside of his shirt , " a spokesman for the sponsors said . 

" It will give the fans something else to look at besides his chest . " 

Ravanelli aggravated a foot injury in the 0-0 defeat at Chelsea on Wednesday and was given only an even chance of playing at Nottingham Forest on Saturday by his manager Bryan Robson . 

TENNIS - <OOV> <OOV> AT CANADIAN OPEN . 

TORONTO 0000-00-00 

It was Australia Day at the $ 0 million Canadian Open on Thursday as three Aussies reached the quarter-finals with straight-set victories . 

Unseeded Patrick Rafter recorded the most noteworthy result as he upset sixth-seeded American MaliVai Washington 0-0 0-0 in just 00 minutes . 

Todd Woodbridge , who defeated Canadian Daniel Nestor 0-0 ( 0-0 ) 0-0 ( 0-0 ) , and Mark Philippoussis , a 0-0 0-0 winner over Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic , also advanced and will meet in Friday 's quarter-finals . 

Third-seeded Wayne Ferreira of South Africa defeated Tim Henman of Britain 0-0 0-0 after a three-hour evening rain delay and fifth-seeded Thomas Enqvist of Sweden won his third-round match , eliminating Petr Korda of the Czech Republic 0-0 0-0 . 

Ferreira and Enqvist play in a Friday night quarter-final . 

Two Americans , seventh seed Todd Martin and unseeded Alex O'Brien , will meet on Friday after winning matches on Thursday . 

Martin overcame Cedric Pioline of France 0-0 0-0 0-0 and O'Brien beat Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden 0-0 0-0 0-0 . 

" If you really look at the match , " said the 00th-ranked Washington after losing to the 00th-ranked Rafter , " I never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net . 

" He was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my ( first ) service percentage was only in the <OOV> . 

Put those two things together and you get a loss . " 

Rafter missed 00 weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective . 

" Before when I was on tour , I always felt I had to be in bed by 0:00 or 00 o'clock and I had to be up at a certain time , " Rafter said . " 

Now I can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning . 

I just do n't have as many set routines and it 's made me a happier person . " 

Martin was pleased with his victory over Pioline , his first in five meetings with the 00th-ranked Frenchman . " 

It 's always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set , especially against someone you have never beaten , " he said . 

" I got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because Cedric definitely went off a little bit . " 

The 00-year-old O'Brien , who won the ATP Tour stop in New Haven last week , has now won 00 of his last 00 matches , dating back to qualifying rounds in Los Angeles in late July . 

He ranks 00th after being 000th four weeks ago . 

" I feel I 'm hitting the ball well even though I 'm having more mental <OOV> than I did last week , " O'Brien said . " 

But I 'm still competing well . " 

" I got a lot of first serves in , " said Enqvist about his victory over Korda . " 

I did n't miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes . " 

Still marvelling at an exciting <OOV> rally he won in the last game of his second-round match against Javier Sanchez of Spain on Tuesday , Enqvist joked , " Today against Petr there were about 00 strokes in the whole match . 

It was mostly short points . "

JOHANNESBURG 0000-00-00 

Centre Japie Mulder has been ruled out of South Africa 's team for the second test against New Zealand in Pretoria on Saturday . 

Mulder missed the first test in Durban with back spasms and failed a fitness check on Thursday . 

But new Springbok skipper Gary Teichmann has recovered from a bruised thigh and is ready to play , coach Andre Markgraaff said . 

Mulder 's absence means that Northern Transvaal centre Andre Snyman should win his second cap alongside provincial colleague Danie van Schalkwyk . 

Wing Pieter Hendriks is expected to retain his place , following speculation that Snyman would be picked out of position on the wing . 

The line-up would not be announced until shortly before the start , Markgraaff said .

Promising 00th-ranked American Chanda Rubin has pulled out of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships with a wrist injury , tournament officials announced . 

The 00-year-old Rubin , who was to be seeded 00th , is still suffering from tendinitis of the right wrist that has kept her sidelined in recent months . 

Rubin 's misfortune turned into a very lucky break for eighth-seeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport . 

Davenport had drawn one of the toughest first-round assignments of any of the seeded players in 00th-ranked Karina Habsudova of Slovakia . 

But as the highest-ranked <OOV> player in the tournament , Habsudova will be moved into Rubin 's slot in the draw , while Davenport will now get a qualifier in the first round , according to U.S. Tennis Association officials . 

Rubin is the third notable withdrawal from the women 's competition after 00th-ranked former Australian Open champion Mary Pierce and 00th-ranked Wimbledon semifinalist Meredith McGrath pulled out earlier this week with injuries . 

Men 's Australian Open champion Boris Becker will also miss the year 's final Grand Slam with a wrist injury .

ATHLETICS - <OOV> BREAKS SECOND WORLD RECORD IN 00 DAYS . 

Adrian Warner 

BRUSSELS 0000-00-00 

Russia 's double Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova smashed her second world record in just 00 days on Friday when she bettered the mark for the women 's 0,000 metres . 

After breaking the world record for the women 's mile in Zurich last Wednesday , the Olympic 000 and 0,000 metres champion clocked two minutes 00.00 seconds over 0,000 at the Brussels grand prix meeting . 

The Russian ate up the ground in a swift last lap to shave 0.00 seconds off the previous best of 0:00.00 set by Mozambique 's Maria Mutola in the same stadium in August last year . 

Former world 000 champion Mutola pushed Masterkova all the way , finishing second in 0:00.00 . 

But it was the Russian who picked up the bonus of $ 00,000 for the historic run in front of a capacity 00,000 crowd . 

Masterkova dominated the middle-distance races at the recent Atlanta Games following her return to competition this season after a three-year maternity break . 

In her first mile race at the richest meeting in Zurich last Wednesday , she slashed 0.00 seconds off the previous record . 

The record of four minutes , 00.00 seconds in Zurich earned Masterkova a bonus of $ 00,000 plus one kilo of gold . 

After Friday 's performance the Russian will have earned well over $ 000,000 in less than a fortnight , taking her appearance money into account . 

Brussels organisers had laid a new track for the meeting comparable to the surface at the Atlanta Games but put down on a softer surface . 

Masterkova clearly enjoyed it . 

Mutola looked threatening in the final 000 metres but the Russian found an extra gear to power home several strides ahead , pointing at the time on the clock with delight as she crossed the line .

ATHLETICS - <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> OF OLYMPIC <OOV> CHAMPIONS .

BRUSSELS 0000-00-00 

American Dennis Mitchell upstaged a trio of past and present Olympic 000 metres champions on Friday with a storming victory at the Brussels grand prix . 

Sporting his customary bright green outfit , the U.S. champion clocked 00.00 seconds despite damp conditions to take the scalp of Canada 's reigning Olympic champion Donovan Bailey , 0000 champion Linford Christie of Britain and American 0000 and 0000 champion Carl Lewis . 

Mitchell also beat world and Olympic champion Bailey at the most lucrative meeting in the sport in Zurich last week . 

The American , who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games , was fast out of his blocks and held off Bailey 's late burst in the final 00 metres before heading off for a lap of celebration . 

The Canadian was second in 00.00 with Lewis third in 00.00 , ahead of Atlanta bronze medallist Ato Boldon who clocked 00.00 in fourth . 

Christie , competing in what is expected to be his last major international meeting , finished fifth in 00.00 . 

Lewis , making a rare appearance in Europe in a sprint race , left the track with a slight limp . 

American Olympic high hurdles champion Allen Johnson defied the wet conditions to produce a brilliant 00.00 seconds in the 000 metres race , just 0.00 outside the world record held by Britain 's Colin Jackson . 

Johnson ran the same time at the U.S. Olympic trials in Atlanta in June to become the second equal fastest hurdler of all time with American Roger Kingdom . 

He seemed to relish the new track at the Brussels meeting , dominating the race from start to finish with a slight wind at his back . 

Jackson , the only man to have run faster , could not live with his speed , taking second in 00.00 seconds . 

The rain was pelting down when the women 's high hurdlers stepped up for their 000 metres race . 

But Sweden 's Olympic high hurdles champion Ludmila Engquist , who crashed out of last week 's meeting in Zurich after hitting a hurdle , also kept her footing perfectly to win in a fast 00.00 seconds . 

Olympic silver medallist Brigita Bukovec of Slovenia could finish only fifth in the race in 00.00 . 

Jamaican Commonwealth champion Michelle Freeman took second in 00.00 ahead of Cuban Aliuska Lopez . 

The Zurich fall cost Engquist a shot at a jackpot of 00 <OOV> gold bars which can be won by athletes who clinch their events at all of the Golden Four series in Oslo , Zurich , Brussels and Berlin . 

Seven athletes went into Friday 's penultimate meeting of the series with a chance of winning the prize and American men 's 000 metres hurdles champion Derrick Adkins kept his hopes alive in the competition by winning his event in 00.00 . 

American Olympic champion Gail Devers clocked a swift 00.00 seconds on her way to victory in the women 's 000 metres , the second fastest time of the season and 0.00 seconds faster than her winning time in Atlanta . 

Jamaican veteran Merlene Ottey , who beat Devers in Zurich after just missing out on the gold medal in Atlanta after a photo finish , had to settle for third place in 00.00 . 

American world champion Gwen Torrence , the bronze medallist in Atlanta , was second in 00.00 . 

It was a costly defeat for Ottey since it threw her out of the race for the Golden Four jackpot .

COLOMBO 0000-00-00 

Sri Lanka and Australia agreed on Friday that relations between the two teams had healed since the Sri Lankans ' acrimonious tour last year . 

The Sri Lankans were first found guilty then cleared of ball tampering and off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was called for throwing during a controversial three-test series in Australia . 

" Our concern is to get out there and play proper cricket , " Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga told a news conference on the eve of a warmup match between the World Cup champions and a World XI team scheduled for Saturday . 

" What happened is history . " 

Australian team manager Cam Battersby said he agreed with Ranatunga . 

" I believe relations between the two teams will be excellent , " <OOV> said . 

The Australians are making their first visit to the Indian Ocean island since boycotting a World Cup fixture in February after a terrorist bomb in Colombo . 

Australia have been promised the presence of commandos , sniffer dogs and plainclothes policemen to ensure a limited overs tournament is trouble-free . 

The tournament , starting on August 00 , also includes India and Zimbabwe . 

Battersby said he was satisfied with the security arrangements . 

Sri Lankan officials said they expected heavy rain which washed out a warmup match on Friday should cease by Saturday . 

Australia , led by wicketkeeper Ian Healy , opened their short tour of Sri Lanka with a five-run win over the country 's youth team on Thursday .

<OOV> DE ANGOLA 

- The Angolan Chief of State addressed a letter to UN Security Council proposing dates for the conclusion of the peace process in Angola . 

He proposed definite dates , August 00 for return of Unita generals to the joint army , September 0 for the beginning of the formation of the Government of National Unity and Reconciliation . 

Until this date the free circulation of peoples and goods should be guaranteed , the government administration installed in all areas and the Unita deputies should occupy their places in the National Assembly . 

The president justified his proposal by the delays verified in the peace process , including the fact that areas under Unita control or occupation have not been effectively demilitarised , where the Unita military forces have been substituted by their so-called police . 

- President Dos Santos proposes the establishment by UN Security Council of definitive and final timetable for the tasks and obligations under the Lusaka Agreement and the sending of a mission of SC , as soon as possible , to supervise the execution of the agreement .

Colombia , U.S. reach aviation agreement . 

MIAMI 0000-00-00 

The U.S. and Colombian governments reached an agreement that will allow AMR Corp 's American Airlines to operate three round-trip flights between New York and Bogota , the Department of Transportation said Friday . 

Under the agreement , which followed talks in Miami this week , AMR also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between Miami and Colombia to its New York gateway . 

The United States also will be able to designate one new all-cargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years . 

Colombia was permitted to add a single additional round-trip flight to its current New York service , although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two ( Conditional ) status under the Federal Aviation Administration 's International Aviation Safety program . 

Colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved , the department said . 

With the exception of the new services just agreed to , the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 0-0/0 years , the agreement said . 

The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when Colombia turned down American 's request to operate flights between New York and Bogota , a denial that prompted the United States to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines , Avianca and ACES .

RTRS - Golf : Norman sacks his coach after disappointing season . 

SYDNEY 0000-00-00 

World number one golfer Greg Norman has sacked his coach Butch Harmon after a disappointing season . 

" Butch and I are finished , " Norman told reporters on Thursday before the start of the World Series of Golf in Akron , Ohio . 

Norman , a two-time British Open champion , parted ways with his long-time mentor after drawing a blank in this year 's four majors , winning two tournaments worldwide . 

The blonde Australian opened with a level par round of 00 in Akron , leaving him four shots adrift of the leaders , Americans Billy Mayfair and Paul Goydos and Japan 's Hidemichi <OOV> . 

On Wednesday Norman described this year as his worst on the professional circuit since 0000 , when he failed to win a tournament . 

" My application this year has been strange , " Norman said . " 

Maybe I have n't been as keyed up as I should have been . " 

" Sometimes you do n't have it in your head to play . 

Maybe this was one of those years where I was there , but I was n't 000 percent there , and you have to be 000 percent to perform , " he said .

Soccer - Arab team breaks new ground in Israel . 

Ori Lewis 

<OOV> , Israel 0000-00-00 

For the first time in Israeli history , an Arab team will take the field when the National League soccer season starts on Saturday . 

Hapoel Taibe fields four Jewish players and two foreign imports -- a Pole and a Romanian . 

The rest of the side is made up mainly of Moslem Arabs . 

The club , founded in 0000 , has a loyal following in Taibe , an Arab town of 00,000 in the heart of Israel . 

But away from their home ground , they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse . 

" The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem , " said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye . 

Two weeks ago Taibe , coached by Pole Wojtek <OOV> , met Betar , a club closely associated with the right-wing Likud party , for the first time in a Cup match in Jerusalem . 

Chants from the crowd of " Death to the Arabs " , and bottle-throwing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw . 

One Taibe supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium . 

" We 're used to hearing the taunts of " Death to the Arabs ' , " said Sameh Haj Yihye , a Taibe resident who studies at Jerusalem 's Hebrew University . " 

But we know that these are only words , nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently . " 

The dusty town of Taibe lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination . 

" There are no parks or empty areas of land around here , so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to Tel Aviv , " 00 km ( 00 miles ) away , Sameh Haj Yihye said . 

The town 's ramshackle <OOV> ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks . 

" We plan to build a <OOV> stadium , but it may well be situated elsewhere , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman Haj Yihye . " 

We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year . " 

In the meantime , Taibe will play all their heavily policed home matches at the Jewish coastal town of Netanya . 

" We are Israelis , there is no question about that , " said Karem Haj Yihye , a hotel waiter . 

" We do n't have any connection with the Palestinians , they live over there , " he said , pointing to the West Bank seven km ( four miles ) to the east . 

" We do n't feel our club represents Palestinian Arabs , " said club chairman Abdul Rahman . " 

We are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit , we are pleased at any support we get , but do not go out looking to represent the whole Arab world . "

Soccer - Manchester United face Juventus in Europe . 

GENEVA 0000-00-00 

European champions Juventus will face English league and cup double winners Manchester United in this season 's European Champions ' League . 

The draw made on Friday pitted Juventus , who beat Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam 0-0 on penalties in last year 's final , against Alex Ferguson 's European hopefuls in group C . 

The other two teams in the group are last season 's Cup Winners ' Cup runners-up Rapid Vienna and Fenerbahce of Turkey . 

Juventus meet United in Turin on September 00 , with the return match at Old Trafford on November 00 . 

United have dominated the premier league in the 0000s , winning three English championships in four years , but have consistently failed in Europe , crashing out of the European Cup to Galatasaray of Turkey and Spain 's Barcelona at their last two attempts . 

They have not lifted a European Trophy since 0000 when they beat Barcelona in the Cup Winners ' Cup final , and their one and only European Cup triumph was way back in 0000 , when they beat Benfica of Portugal 0-0 at Wembley . 

Juventus have won the European Cup twice . 

Before conquering Ajax last year they beat United 's big English rivals Liverpool in the ill-fated 0000 final in the Heysel stadium in Brussels .

Orthodox church blown up in southern Croatia . 

ZAGREB 0000-00-00 

Saboteurs blew up a Serb orthodox church in southern Croatia on Friday with a blast which also damaged four nearby homes , the state news agency Hina reported . 

HINA said the church in the small village of Karin Gornji , 00 km ( 00 miles ) north of Zadar , was destroyed by the morning attack . 

It did not report any casualties . 

Zadar police said in a statement they had launched an investigation and were doing their best to find the perpetrators . 

HINA said it was the first time an orthodox church had been blown up in the Zadar hinterland , where a large number of Serbs lived before the 0000 war over Croatia 's independence from the Yugoslav federation . 

The area was part of the self-styled state of Krajina proclaimed by minority Serbs in 0000 and recaptured by the Croatian army last year . 

Up to 000,000 Serbs fled to Bosnia and Yugoslavia , leaving Krajina vacant and depopulated .

Russians , Chechens say observing Grozny ceasefire . 

GROZNY , Russia 0000-00-00 

Rebel fighters and Russian soldiers said a ceasefire effective at noon ( 0000 GMT ) on Friday was being generally observed , although scattered gunfire echoed through the Chechen capital Grozny . 

The Russian army said earlier it was preparing to withdraw from the rebel-dominated southern mountains of the region as part of the peace deal reached with separatists on Thursday . 

" There has been some shooting from their side but it has been relatively quiet , " said fighter Aslan <OOV> , a bearded man wearing a white t-shirt and <OOV> trousers . 

Soon after he spoke another burst of gunfire rocked the courtyard where the rebels had set up their base and a captured Russian <OOV> tank roared out to investigate . 

The separatists , who swept into Grozny on August 0 , still control large areas of the centre of town , and Russian soldiers are based at checkpoints on the approach roads . 

" The ceasefire is being observed , " said woman soldier Svetlana <OOV> , 00 , short dark hair poking out from under a peaked camouflage cap . 

A few helicopters flew overhead , firing off flares , but there was no shooting from the air . 

The truce , the latest of several , was agreed in talks on Thursday between Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov . 

The two also agreed to set up joint patrols in Grozny , but <OOV> said she was sceptical about whether this could work .

BELGRADE 0000-00-00 

Yugoslavia and Croatia were poised on Friday to sign a landmark normalisation treaty ending five years of tensions and paving way for stabilisation in the Balkans . 

Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic landed at Belgrade airport aboard a Croatian government jet on Friday morning for talks with his Yugoslav counterparts and a signing ceremony expected around noon ( 0000 GMT ) . 

On Thursday the Yugoslav government endorsed the text of the agreement on normalising relations between the two countries , the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said . 

" The government assessed the agreement as a crucial step to resolving the Yugoslav crisis , ensuring the restoration of peace in former Yugoslavia , " it said .

Jordan expels Iraqi diplomat after bread riots .

AMMAN 0000-00-00 

Jordan , which has blamed Iraq for bread riots last week , has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave , official and diplomatic sources said on Friday . 

The main Friday prayers in southern Jordan that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported . 

Adel Ibrahim , the Iraqi embassy 's press attache , was asked to leave " because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms " , one source told Reuters , implying he was accused of spying . 

Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone from his embassy office in Amman that he " had not been notified " of any explusion order . 

The government declined official comment . 

Ibrahim 's assistant , Hussein Khalaf , was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King Hussein began calling for change in Baghdad following top Iraqi defections in August 0000 . 

Iraq retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with Jordan -- its only secure route to the rest of the world . 

Jordan has accused Iraq and a local pro-Baghdad party for the country 's worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund . 

In Karak , where two days of riots flared last Friday , a few hundred young men lingered outside Omari mosque on leaving , shouting slogans for about 00 minutes . 

" <OOV> , abstain from forming groups and help maintain order , " army officers , who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots , told the crowd through loudspeakers . 

The men shouted " Allahu Akbar " ( God is Greatest ) as a former Islamist deputy , Ahmed <OOV> , told soldiers the crowd would not cause trouble . 

He had earlier mounted the mosque 's pulpit to demand release of detainees , an end to raids on houses and the cancelling of the bread price rises . 

Armoured cars had patrolled streets in Karak , traditional bastion of communist ideology and Baath socialism that swept the region in the 0000s , and guarded entrances to the hill-top city famed for its Crusader castle before the prayers . 

There was also heavy security in the crowded centre of Amman , where smaller clashes had erupted last Saturday , but Friday prayers at the main mosque ended quietly as police in full riot gear looked on . 

The Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party , which has one deputy in the <OOV> lower house of parliament , has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship . 

Government attempts to link the rioting to foreign influence has been treated with derision by those in the streets who blame the protests on severe economic hardships . 

Turkey says killed 00 Kurd rebels in clashes . 

ANKARA 0000-00-00 

Turkish troops have killed 00 Kurdish rebels in recent clashes in the southeast of the country , the state-run Anatolian news agency said on Friday . 

Two security officials and two state-paid village guards were killed in the fighting with Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) guerrillas , the agency quoted the emergency rule governor 's office as saying . 

Eight of the rebels were killed in Van province , five in Sirnak and four in Hakkari . 

The agency did not say when the clashes took place . 

More than 00,000 people have died in the PKK 's 00-year-old fight for independence or autonomy in southeastern Turkey . 

Three people , including two village guards , died when a mine planted by PKK rebels exploded on a road in the southeast , Anatolian reported earlier . 

It said a taxi carrying the guards , members of a mostly Kurdish militia which fights the PKK , hit the mine in the province of Diyarbakir . 

U.S. says Iraqi Kurds agree ceasefire . 

WASHINGTON 0000-00-00 

Leaders of Iraq 's two main Kurdish factions agreed on Friday to end six days of fighting and to attend <OOV> peace talks next month , the State Department said . 

Spokesman Glyn Davies said in a statement that the agreement followed direct U.S. contacts with Massoud Barzani , leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , and Jalal Talabani , leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) . 

Davies said the two leaders " have agreed to cease the fighting ( and ) return their forces to the positions held before the current fighting began " on August 00 . 

He did not give a specific time for the ceasefire but said the United States looked forward to " immediate implementation " . 

The two party leaders had also agreed to meet U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Robert Pelletreau in September " to solidify the cease-fire and to pursue reconciliation " , Davies said . 

His statement gave no venue or precise date for the meeting . 

The United States has already called on the Kurdish factions to hold peace talks in London . 

The KDP said Thursday night it had repelled an attack by thousands of PUK fighters , killing , wounding or capturing about 000 opposing guerrillas . 

The fighting has threatened a U.S.-led peace plan to unite the mountainous Kurdish region in northern Iraq against President Saddam Hussein . 

One teen left dead by attack on U.S. slumber party . 

<OOV> , Va . 

0000-00-00 

A knife-wielding neighbour apparently intent on sexual assault invaded a teenage slumber party on Friday , killing one girl and wounding three others , police said . 

At about 0 a.m. EDT ( 0000 GMT ) , a group of teenaged girls were having the overnight party in the Camelot subdivision of this eastern Virginia city , when a man entered the house , wielding a knife , threatening to sexually assault the girls . 

Detective Richard Black of the Chesapeake Police Department , said a neighbour , Curtis Lee White II , 00 , was arrested in the attack , but had not been charged by late morning on Friday . 

There were apparently no adults at the party as the father of the family who lived in the house was out of town and the mother died more than a year ago , Black said . 

The detective said details were sketchy , but two of the teenagers were reportedly downstairs watching television when White allegedly entered the house and told the girls to take off their clothes . 

He said a male teenager sleeping upstairs reportedly heard the commotion and came downstairs and confronted White , who allegedly stabbed him more than once . 

The other teenagers also confronted the assailant and three girls , all under 00 , were stabbed , one fatally . 

" At least two of them were sexually molested , " Black said . 

He said all of the wounded teenagers were taken to a hospital but none of the injuries were considered life-threatening . 

Police said the girl who died was identified as Michelle Harper . 

Her age was not given .

Washington to curb Tamil support in U.S. - Sri Lanka . 

COLOMBO 0000-00-00 

Sri Lanka said on Friday the United States had promised to stamp out any illegal activities on U.S. soil directed against the island 's government . 

The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said in a statement : " The United States government sympathised with the current predicament Sri Lanka was facing . " 

The statement said the U.S. government " would do all within its prevailing legal framework to prevent the use of American soil to perpetrate violence against the democratic government of Sri Lanka " . 

It said the U.S. State Department 's coordinator for counter terrorism , Philip Wilcox , had expressed Washington 's support for the government when he visited Colombo this week . 

Colombo has said it believes Tamil rebels , fighting a 00-year war for independence against the government , finance their military activity through funds extorted from expatriate Sri Lankans in western countries such as the United States . 

U.S. embassy officials in Colombo were not immediately available to comment on the report . 

Colombo estimates more than 00,000 people have been killed in the war between government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels in the island 's north and east . 

Nepal 's king leaves on week-long visit to China . 

KATHMANDU 0000-00-00 

King Birendra left Nepal on Friday for a week-long visit to China , his eighth since ascending the throne in 0000 , officials said . 

The constitutional monarch , who last visited China in 0000 , was scheduled to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng during his visit , they said . 

Foreign ministry officials gave no details of the issues the king , who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani , would discuss with Chinese leaders . 

The Himalayan kingdom , sandwiched between China and India , has traditionally sought to maintain close cooperation with its giant neighbours , and an equal distance from the two . 

The 00-year old monarch was accompanied by Queen Aishwarya on a flight to the Tibetan capital of Lhasa . 

The king will visit Chongqing before arriving in the Chinese capital , Beijing , early next week , officials said . 

Nepal man held for keeping child servant in chains . 

KATHMANDU 0000-00-00 

Nepali police said on Friday they arrested a man who allegedly kept a child servant bound in chains so that he would not run away when his employer was out to work . 

<OOV> <OOV> was arrested on Thursday after his neighbours informed police about the plight of 00-year old <OOV> K.C. , who told police his employer used to tie him up with iron chains and locks concealed under his clothes . 

The neighbours in Kathmandu called the police when they saw <OOV> , employed by the man for the past nine months , limping because of the chains . 

" I feared he would flee from work or steal my belongings , " the Kathmandu Post newspaper quoted <OOV> as saying after his arrest . 

If convicted , he faces a maximum of three years in jail under Nepal 's child protection laws . 

OPTIONS - Euro debt <OOV> seen regrouping after fall . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

<OOV> volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week 's German-led cut in interest rates , traders said . 

" Volatility has come off a lot . 

We 're looking for it to stabilise now , " said one Euromark options trader at a U.S. bank . 

A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at 00.00 for September contract , 00.00 for December , 00.00 for March and 00.00 for June . 

This compared with midweek levels , before the welter of interest rate cuts , of 00.00 for September , 00.00 for December , 00.00 for March and 00.0 for June , he said . 

At 0000 GMT , December Euromark futures were trading at 00.00 , two basis points down on the day . 

He said the sell-off in June <OOV> might have been overdone , which could offer value at current levels . 

He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end . 

The size of the Bundesbank 's repo rate cut , to 0.00 percent from 0.00 percent , took markets by surprise . 

" Volatility has a bid to it -- <OOV> volatility more than <OOV> because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol , " he said . 

" Long dated volatility has been low this year , so it is still at levels which are not historically high . 

" It is not a dangerous level to own <OOV> You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit . " 

He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in Britain . 

Paribas Capital Markets OTC options specialist Robert Coughlan said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in over-the-counter 00-year Bunds , it should be higher next Tuesday . 

He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in high-yielding markets such as Italy , Spain and Sweden . 

Coughlan said the market had more downside than upside potential , but a fall was not likely to be of significant size . 

" I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets -- in Germany and France in particular . 

" With high-yielding markets Italy will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts , so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options . 

" So sell options on Bunds and France to enhance yield and buy options on Italy , " Coughlan said ..

Legal challenge to Diana delayed by jail term . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

A British photographer branded a stalker by Princess Diana has been forced to postpone a legal challenge to a ban on approaching her because he 's been jailed for criminal damage , his lawyer said on Friday . 

Martin Stenning started a <OOV> jail sentence on Thursday just as he was preparing to contest an injunction obtained by Diana banning him from coming within 000 metres ( yards ) of her . 

" We were in the process of preparing a detailed affidavit responding to the Princess 's affadavit and expected to go to court in the next couple of weeks , " said Stenning 's lawyer , Benedict <OOV> . " 

But everything has been put on ice now . " 

<OOV> told Reuters that the challenge to the injunction would be delayed until Stenning was released . 

Stenning threw a brick through the window of a van in February after an argument with a driver when he was working as a motorcycle dispatch rider . 

Stenning , who has previous convictions , is expected to appeal against the sentence . 

Magistrates also ordered him to pay compensation of 000 pounds ( $ 000 ) . 

The freelance photographer was branded a stalker by Diana , whose divorce from <OOV> Prince Charles is due to become final next week , after persistently trailing her on his motorcycle . 

In an affidavit , the princess said that in chasing her Stenning had got so close that he twice smashed into her car and pushed her when she tried to remove the film from his camera . 

Stenning has rejected Diana 's claims and said he was being made a scapegoat to scare off press photographers . 

Jordan expels Iraqi diplomat . 

AMMAN 0000-00-00 

Jordan has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave the kingdom for carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms , an official source said on Friday . 

The move came after Amman blamed Iraq and a pro-Baghdad local political party for last week 's worst unrest in seven years after a government decision to double prices of bread . 

The government declined comment . 

" Jordan has asked Mr. Adel Ibrahim , the Iraqi embassy 's press attache , to leave because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms , " the source told Reuters . 

He said Ibrahim was still in Amman . 

The Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship . 

The riots , which shook Jordan for two days , broke out after last Friday 's main prayers in the southern town of Karak and spread to Amman . 

Kurd rebels to free Turkish soldier prisoners . 

<OOV> , Iraq 0000-00-00 

Turkish Kurd guerrillas said on Friday they would free seven Turkish soldiers they hold in northern Iraq under a tentative Islamist peace bid . 

" <OOV> the sake of safety we are asking for their family members or the authorities to come and pick them up , " Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) central committee member Riza Altun told journalists near the Iraqi city of Dohuk . 

PKK guerrillas would accompany the soldiers , captured last spring in one of Turkey 's frequent cross-border drives , until they could be handed over , he said . 

Their release has been negotiated by Islamist writer Ismail Nacar as part of a wider effort , partly backed by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan , to find a political solution to Turkey 's Kurdish problem . 

Erbakan has encouraged Nacar 's bid but has ruled out direct talks with the rebels . 

The PKK often uses bases in northern Iraq in its fight for autonomy or independence in southeast Turkey . 

More than 00,000 people have died in 00 years of fighting between the guerrillas and Turkish forces .

Zenith lands $ 0 billion contract , plans $ 000 million plant . 

Susan <OOV> 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

A consortium of telephone companies and The Walt Disney Co . 

said Thursday it had signed a $ 0 billion contract with Zenith to make digital televison set-top boxes for its home entertainment service . 

The announcement of the contract for 0 million set-top boxes gave new hope to Zenith , which has struggled with years of losses . 

" This really indicates we 're back in the business , " William Luehrs , president of the <OOV> , <OOV> company 's Networks Services Division , said in a telephone interview . " 

Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry . " 

Following the announcement , Zenith 's stock soared $ 0.00 to $ 00.000 on the New York Stock Exchange . 

The consortium , called Americast , said the contract was part of its strategy to develop and market the next generation in home entertainment . 

In addition to Disney , Americast 's partners are phone companies Ameritech Corp. , BellSouth Corp. , GTE Corp. and SBC Communications . 

Americast said Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. has signed a letter of intent to join the group , which plans to provide a home entertainment service similar to cable television . 

Zenith also said it planned to build a new $ 000 million plant in <OOV> , Ill . 

, to make picture tubes for <OOV> and <OOV> screen TV sets . 

The company currently buys the tubes from competitors . 

The new plant , which is dependent on obtaining financing , will create about 000 new jobs , Zenith said . 

The contract calls for production of the set-top boxes over five years . 

Luehrs said manufacturing will begin and revenue will start to roll in during the first half of next year . 

The boxes will be made on a <OOV> basis . 

Zenith will convert its Chihuahua , Mexico , analogue set-top box plant to manufacture the digital boxes . 

Luehrs declined to say when the operation was expected to be profitable . 

Americast will provide the boxes to subscribers as part of the service . 

Its service is being introduced in selected markets across the United States . 

Luehrs said digital technology in set-top boxes is only the beginning and said the technology will eventually show up in retail consumer electronics . 

" We 'll build a lot of these devices into television sets , for digital television , " he said . " 

Although that is not where this particular contract is headed , the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future . " 

Zenith has been plagued by generally soft conditions in the colour television industry , reporting full-year losses since 0000 . 

Last month , it reported a second-quarter loss of $ 00.0 million , or 00 cents a share , vs. a loss of $ 00.0 million , or 00 cents a share , a year earlier . 

Last November , South Korea-based LG Electronics Inc. bought a majority stake in Zenith . 

Robert <OOV> , an analyst for <OOV> , Voorhis & Co . 

, said the contract was " not unique , but it 's big . " 

" Digital is coming , it 's economic and the question is what will make the consumer happy and at what price . " 

Natural Law Party says it can meditate problems away . 

WASHINGTON 0000-00-00 

From the people who brought you hundreds of " yogic fliers " who claimed to defy nature by <OOV> comes The Natural Law Party , a minor political party that nominated a presidential candidate on Thursday . 

At a hotel convention here , the party associated with the Transcendental Meditation ( TM ) movement named physicist John Hagelin as its presidential nominee for the Nov. 0 election . 

The party is running on a platform claiming it can ward off problems before they occur through techniques such as mass meditation that would reduce stress , crime , terrorism and even wars . 

" Social stress can be reduced and problems such as crime and violence will automatically decrease , " said a party paper . 

Many party members are practitioners of TM , which involves meditating to a repeated word or phrase , called a mantra . 

Some advanced TM followers contend they can actually mediate to such a point that they fly . 

But in a demonstration of " yogic flying " several years ago , critics said the people were merely bouncing off the ground from a sitting position . 

Huge Windows 00 sales fail to meet expectations . 

Martin <OOV> 

SEATTLE 0000-00-00 

A year after its massively publicized introduction , Microsoft Corp. 's Windows 00 computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry . 

Even though more than 00 million copies of Windows 00 have been sold , making it the fastest-selling new software ever , it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug. 00 , 0000 launch , when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers . 

The Redmond , <OOV> company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York 's Empire State building in a Windows color scheme . 

But the product , delivered eight months late , has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers , analysts said . 

" It did n't do as well as it could have , " said Rob Enderle , an analyst with Giga Information Group . 

Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized . 

" People who were expecting major coat-tails were somewhat disappointed , " said Scott Winkler , an analyst with Gartner Group . 

" It 's not as though it has n't had an impact , " he said . " 

It just has n't had the huge earth-shattering impact some people were looking for . " 

Symantec Corp. , which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows 00 launch , ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections . 

Touchstone Software Corp. had to pay $ 0.0 million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company 's sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows 00 launch . 

Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blue-and-white boxes of Windows 00 , resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products , said Ann Stephens , president of PC Data Inc . 

To be sure , sales of Windows 00 and the accompanying Office 00 upgrade drove Microsoft sales up 00 percent last year to a record $ 0.00 billion and cemented the company 's status as the industry 's dominant company . 

Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures , and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year , the installed base of Windows 00 will surpass that of the older version of Windows , now used on about 000 million computers worldwide . 

But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system . 

He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a go-slow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its high-end Windows NT operating system , expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks . 

" Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer , " Winkler said . " 

Many people began to believe that Windows 00 was being downplayed . " 

But now that Windows NT 0.0 has been launched , Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows 00 . 

" Windows 00 is going to do great , " he said . " 

The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast , sweeping change rather than a slow , building change . " 

U.S. says still committed to Cuba migration pacts . 

WASHINGTON 0000-00-00 

The United States said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with Cuba and would continue to repatriate intercepted Cuban migrants who attempted to enter U.S. territory illegally . 

A State Department statement appeared in part a response to Cuban complaints that Washington was jeopardising the accords by failing to return some of the Cubans involved in recent illegal migration incidents . 

" The United States reiterates its full commitment to the implementation " of the accords signed by the two countries in 0000 and 0000 , said the statement by spokesman Glyn Davies . 

" The United States will continue to return Cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the United States or the Guantanamo Naval Base illegally , " it said . 

Washington would also take " prompt and effective law enforcement action " against alien smuggling and hijackings from Cuba , it added . 

Davies told reporters the statement would be distributed in the Cuban exile community in Miami " to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits " from Cuba to Florida . 

Havana 's complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the Florida Straits last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from Cuba . 

Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to Cuba but eight were taken to the United States and three to Guantanamo Bay , a U.S. base on Cuba , until they emigrated to another nation . 

The most recent hijacking , last Friday , involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft . 

Davies said on Tuesday the pilot could soon return to Cuba but U.S. authorities planned to try the hijackers . 

In an incident on July 0 , a Cuban interior ministry official hijacked a commercial plane and sought <OOV> at Guantanamo Bay . 

Davies said he knew of no plans to return the man to Cuba . 

Wis . 

says is first state to apply for new welfare . 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

In keeping with its pioneering image in the area of welfare , Wisconsin was the first state to submit an administrative plan under the nation 's new welfare law , Gov . 

Tommy Thompson said Thursday . 

According to a new release from the governor , Wisconsin submitted a plan to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for administration of the new block grant system for welfare just minutes after President Bill Clinton signed the measure into law Thursday . 

" As the nation 's leader in welfare reform , Wisconsin is far ahead of the curve and ready to go under this new system , " Thompson said . 

Still , the governor said the new law does not go as far as the state 's own welfare reform program , dubbed <OOV> . 

He said that despite the new law , Wisconsin will still require federal waivers allowing the working poor to acquire health care coverage from the state , a 00-day residency requirement for participation in the welfare program , and child support collections to go directly to custodial parents . 

The nation 's new welfare reform law limits eligibility , gives states more power and ends direct federal aid for poor children .

<OOV> Vietnamese man takes slow train to Alaska . 

ANCHORAGE , Alaska 0000-00-00 

A Vietnamese man who tried to take a <OOV> in a railway boxcar in Canada found himself locked in and bound for Alaska with no food or water .

Phan 's accidental journey started last week in Prince Rupert , British Columbia , where he was searching for a fishing job , Jewell said . 

" He had climbed up in this boxcar to get out of the weather and to get some sleep , " Jewell said . "

State , federal agents probe Arkansas church fires .

LITTLE ROCK , Ark . 

0000-00-00 

State and federal agents on Thursday sifted through the rubble of two predominantly black Arkansas churches that burned within minutes of one another late Tuesday and early Wednesday . 

Both churches were in the Mississippi delta region of Arkansas , about 00 miles ( 000 kms ) southeast of Little Rock , and were located within three miles of one another . 

" We 're investigating with the idea that both fires may be arson , but that has n't been conclusively established , " said Wayne Jordan , a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police . 

Agents of the <OOV> and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms were also at the scene , Jordan said . 

Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church and St. Matthews Missionary Baptist Church were both frame structures , each near Turner , Arkansas , a small community surrounded by cotton and soybean fields . 

" This is rural Arkansas . 

I 'm surprised anyone could even find us out here , " said Fannie Johnson , a member of St. Matthew 's , who said she believed arson was to blame . 

Others connected with the two churches said they shared that suspicion , although all said they knew of no motive and no racial tension in the area . 

" It 's sad someone would have that kind of spite in their heart , " said Rev. Jerome Turner , pastor of Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church . 

Arkansas has been spared the loss of predominantly black churches to arson , a wave that has claimed an estimated 00 houses of worship across the south in the past several months . 

A black church near Camden , Arkansas , about 000 miles ( 000 kms ) south of Little Rock , burned in July , but federal agents have not determined the cause .

AMSTERDAM 0000-00-00 

Dutch post and telecoms group Koninklijke PTT Nederland NV 's ( Dutch PTT ) first half results came marginally below most analysts ' forecasts , giving scant grounds to adjust full year estimates , analysts said on Friday .

Sea lion paparazzi to keep tabs on whales . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

U.S. marine biologists have trained a pair of sea lions to tag and photograph elusive whales as they cruise through the Pacific depths , New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday . 

James Harvey and Jennifer Hurley of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California say their sea lions , natural companions of many species of whale , can go where no man or woman has ever gone before . 

" Any diver knows that when a whale gets going you ca n't keep up , " Harvey told the magazine . " 

That is why we know only about five percent of what whales do . " 

The sea lions -- 00-year-old Beaver and nine-year-old Sake -- have undergone six years of training for their mission . 

Beaver once worked for the U.S. Navy and Sake is an amusement park veteran . 

Harvey said they could accurately tag whales with a radio transmitter , and could also swim all the way around one of the giant mammals , filming it with a video camera . 

Their first assignment , later this year , will be documenting humpback whale migration off Monterey , California . 

The article did not spell out exactly how the sea lions manage to tag the whales but said in training they were taught to stick a radio transmitter on to a plastic model of a whale using suction cups . 

RTRS - Australia Senate jeopardises rate cut - Howard . 

CANBERRA 0000-00-00 

Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the possibility of lower interest rates was being jeopardised by Parliament 's upper house where opposition parties planned to scrutinise the 0000/00 budget .

Senior ministers have repeatedly warned since the <OOV> budget was handed down on Tuesday night that the chance of lower official rates could be hampered in the Senate . 

The budget contained sharp spending cuts in areas such as the labour market to reduce the deficit to about A$ 0.0 billion .

China copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade . 

Lynne O'Donnell 

HONG KONG 0000-00-00 

Up to 000,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday . 

Around 00,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of <OOV> , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said . 

Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July . 

It was unclear whether or not the 00,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper . 

Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 00 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise . 

But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not . 

" If they spend all this money moving the copper to <OOV> , it will be sitting there for years , " he said . 

" Once it arrives in <OOV> , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , " he said . 

Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it . 

Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) . 

A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price . 

CNIEC lent around 00,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 0000 on behalf of the state reserve , running the state stockpile down to 000,000 tonnes from 000,000 tonnes previously . 

Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$ 0,000 a tonne , and then paid somewhere between $ 0,000 and $ 0,000 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year . 

This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit , which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs . 

Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market . 

Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics ( <OOV> ) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 00,000 tonnes , " whoever they are , is the most important short-term fundamental " in an already tight world market . 

<OOV> repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp , with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $ 0.0 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals . 

Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement . 

Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses . 

They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases . 

They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market . 

But these concerns were irrelevant , a Singapore trader said , despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year . 

As with many commodities , " there is a desire ( by the Chinese government ) to keep a stockpile of the metal , " he said . " 

You do n't keep it to help industry , you keep it in case of emergency . "

CRICKET - <OOV> <OOV> TO <OOV> UP TITLE CHALLENGE . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

Essex are set to step up their English county championship challenge with a fifth consecutive victory after new-ball pair Neil Williams and Mark Ilott sent Gloucestershire reeling on Saturday . 

Williams seized two wickets in two deliveries and left-armer Ilott also captured two as Gloucestershire , 000 behind on first innings , slumped to 00 for four at the close on the third day of the four-day game at Colchester . 

Essex , who started the current round of matches in fifth place 00 points behind leaders Derbyshire with a game in hand , could go top if they complete victory on Monday 's last day and other results favour them . 

Williams thrust Essex on course for success by dispatching Matt Windows and Andrew Symonds in his second over , before Ilott removed Dominic Hewson and Tim Hancock to reduce Gloucestershire to 00 for four at one stage . 

The visitors had started the day optimistically by sending back former England captain Graham Gooch when he added just six to his overnight 000 , but Essex went on to make 000 for eight before declaring . 

Captain Paul Prichard plundered 00 from 00 deliveries , hitting 00 fours and one six . 

Second-placed Kent were frustrated by rain which prevented any play at Cardiff , where they have reached 000 for three in their first innings against Glamorgan , while third-placed Surrey are facing an uphill task against Nottinghamshire . 

Surrey slipped to 00 for four in reply to Notts ' commanding first innings of 000 for nine declared at Trent Bridge , before Alistair Brown struck a <OOV> half-century . 

Brown 's 00 not out , containing eight fours and three sixes , lifted Surrey to 000 for four on a rain-curtailed day . 

Fourth-placed Leicestershire had Hampshire on the ropes at Leicester before rain intervened . 

Pace trio David Millns ( 0-00 ) , Gordon Parsons ( 0-00 ) and Vince Wells ( 0-00 ) had Hampshire reeling at 00 for seven in reply to the home county 's first innings of 000 . 

Yorkshire rekindled their title hopes after three successive defeats by taking the upper hand against arch-rivals Lancashire at Old Trafford . 

Facing Yorkshire 's 000 for eight declared , Lancashire were forced to follow on 000 behind after being bowled out for 000 , paceman Darren Gough polishing off the innings with a burst of three wickets for one run in 00 deliveries . 

Lancashire then reached 000 for five at the close -- just four ahead -- after Neil Fairbrother hit 00 in 00 balls to add to his first innings of 00 .

LONDON 0000-00-00 

Newcastle 's early season teething problems continued on Saturday when they lost 0-0 at home to premier league pacesetters Sheffield Wednesday . 

England striker Alan Shearer gave Kevin Keegan 's <OOV> side the lead from the penalty spot after 00 minutes after Wednesday 's Yugoslav Dejan Stefanovic pulled down Colombian forward Faustino Asprilla . 

But two minutes later Wednesday equalised through Peter Atherton , who found space in the penalty area to meet Mark Pembridge 's free kick with a precise glancing header . 

Guy Whittingham stole three points for the Yorkshire side with a goal 00 minutes from time . 

To add to Newcastle 's misery , England striker Les Ferdinand was stretchered off in the second half . 

Wednesday , who escaped relegation on the final day of last season , have now won their first three games of the season . 

Elsewhere , title hopefuls Liverpool were held 0-0 at home by newly-promoted Sunderland , and in London , the tie between Tottenham Hotspur and Everton also ended goaless . 

Frenchman Frank LeBoeuf and Italian Gianluca Vialli scored their first premier league goals as Chelsea beat Coventry 0-0 , and managerless Arsenal won by the same scoreline at Leicester .

The Springboks would have gone ahead had not fly-half Joel Stransky 's conversion hit an upright and New Zealand only scrambled to safety through a fine penalty from replacement fly-half Jon Preston and a drop goal by number eight Zinzan Brooke .

AMSTERDAM 0000-00-00 

Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing 0-0 away at Heerenveen . 

Ajax , who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating NAC of Breda in their opening game , had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock . 

Eight minutes after the interval , Heerenveen 's Romeo Wouden broke through the Amsterdam defence , left defender John Veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar into the Ajax net . 

Ajax , without injured defenders Marcio Santos and Winston Bogarde and strikers Jari Litmanen and Marc Overmars , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise . 

But they left gaps at the back and on 00 minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half , beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar . 

The defeat means Ajax 's main title contenders PSV Eindhoven , who beat the champions 0-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat Groningen on Sunday .

British hostage in Chechnya describes ordeal . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

A British aid worker , held hostage in Chechnya for nearly four weeks , said on Saturday a cocked Kalashnikov had been thrust into his mouth at one point during his ordeal . 

Michael Penrose , a 00-year-old worker with the group Action Against Hunger , described his ordeal to a news conference when he arrived back in Britain from Moscow . 

" The worst period of physical manhandling was during that time when we were beaten with Kalashnikovs and at one point I had a Kalashnikov held to the back of my throat -- cocked , " he said . 

" For the first period we were held in a small room with no bed or anything . 

We had very little food and sometimes went two or three days without eating . " 

Gunmen seized Penrose , who comes from <OOV> in southern England , Frenchman Frederic Malardeau and six other hostages from their car in Grozny , the capital of Chechnya , on July 00 . 

The assailants had demanded a ransom of 000,000 pounds ( $ 000,000 ) but no money was paid by the charity when they were released on Wednesday . 

The hostages were held in a house in or near Grozny which was bombarded regularly . 

" During the last 00 days of being held , the fighting in Grozny was very close . 

At first it was street fighting outside the house and then we came under very heavy shelling and bombardment from conventional weapons like tanks , artillery and grenade launchers , " he said . 

Penrose had been working for the charity which provides food to civilians for only a few weeks before he was captured . 

When asked if he would return to the mountainous region where rebels have been fighting Russian troops for full independence , Penrose said : " Not for the time being . 

I do n't think it 's safe for me . 

But maybe in the future , depending on the circumstances . " 

Princess Diana send message to Mother Teresa . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

Britain 's Princess Diana has sent a message to seriously ill Mother Teresa , the nun to whom she has turned several times for spiritual guidance . 

Diana 's office said on Saturday the princess had sent a message to the Nobel Peace Prize-winning missionary as news broke this week of her battle against heart problems and malaria . 

A spokeswoman declined to release details of the message . 

Diana first met the Albanian-born missionary in Rome in 0000 . 

She said afterwards that the meeting had fulfilled her " dearest wish " and the two women have met several times since . 

The princess , who has carved out a major role for herself as a helper of the sick and needy , is said to have turned to Mother Teresa for guidance as her marriage crumbled to heir to the British throne Prince Charles . 

The 00-year-old nun said in the past that she was praying for the couple , whose divorce is expected to become final next week . 

Doctors caring for Mother Teresa in a Calcutta hospital said on Saturday that her fever had fallen and her malaria was under control but she remained on a respirator in intensive care .

<OOV> , British Columbia 0000-00-00 

About 000 adventurers from nine countries set out on Saturday to climb , raft , bike and run in a <OOV> ( <OOV> ) endurance race through the Canadian wilderness . 

The event , called the Eco-Challenge , is part of a growing sport known as adventure racing in which competitors test their limits for days over a perilous wilderness course . 

" I 'm looking forward to this race . 

I think it will be more physically challenging and we 'll have to go up against more diverse situations due to the terrain , " said Dr. Michael Stroud , a veteran Eco-Challenge participant .

His health was the subject of much recent speculation .

He spent a year under house arrest and was tried but acquitted last year on charges of ordering the murder of four opponents in 0000 . 

Zimbabwe fires striking civil servants . 

<OOV> Sithole 

HARARE 0000-00-00 

The Zimbabwean government fired thousands of workers on Saturday for defying an order to end a strike which has crippled essential services and disrupted international and domestic flights . 

The Public Service Commission ( PSC ) said in a statement that the workers -- including nurses , junior doctors , mortuary attendants , customs officers and firefighters -- would be barred from entering their workplaces on Monday . 

" All civil servants who did not return to work at their normal working hours , and remained working for the full working day on 00 August 0000 , have been summarily dismissed ... 

with immediate effect , " it said in a statement . 

Union officials from the Public Service Association ( PSA ) were unavailable for comment . 

Public Service , Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro told state radio her ministry had already begun recruiting other people to replace the strikers , sub-contracting some of the work to private firms . 

The government had been threatening to fire the workers since the strike began on Tuesday , saying it was illegal . 

But the strikers ignored the threat and vowed to stay on the streets until their demands for wage rises of 00 to 00 percent were met . 

The stoppage has left essential services stretched with many hospitals handling only emergency cases under senior doctors with the help of army medical personnel and the Red Cross . 

It has also disrupted flights . 

Some internal services were cancelled , leaving tourists at the Victoria Falls resort stranded , and flights abroad were delayed . 

The PSA said 00 percent of the country 's 000,000 civil servants took part in the strike which is a rare challenge to President Robert Mugabe , who has been in power since independence from Britain in 0000 . 

Opposition parties , civic organisations and private-sector unions have expressed support for the action and denounced the government 's pay rises of up to eight percent for its workers . 

Civil servants earn on average <OOV> 0,000 ( $ 000 ) a month . 

They say their pay has not kept up at all with inflation , currently running at 00 percent . 

Rwanda says Zaire expels 00 Rwandan refugees . 

KIGALI 0000-00-00 

Rwanda said on Saturday that Zaire had expelled 00 Rwandan Hutu refugees accused of being " trouble-makers " in camps in eastern Zaire . 

Captain Firmin Gatera , spokesman for the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army , told Reuters in Kigali that 00 of the 00 refugees handed over on Friday from the Zairean town of Goma had been soldiers in the former Hutu army which fled to Zaire in 0000 after being defeated by Tutsi forces in Rwanda 's civil war . 

Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said on Thursday in a visit to Rwanda that his country would expell all the refugees back to Rwanda but he gave no timeframe . 

Zaire is home to 0.0 million Rwandan Hutu refugees who fled three months of civil war in 0000 . 

Many had taken part in the genocide that year of one million people , mostly Tutsis , and refuse to go home for fear of reprisal at the hands of the new Tutsi-dominated government in Kigali . 

Gatera said the refugees were handed over following a deal made at a meeting between the governor of Zaire 's north Kivu region and his counterpart in the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi . 

" After a meeting between the governor of north Kivu and the prefect of Gisenyi , 00 prisoners ( refugees ) were handed over to Rwandan authorities on Friday , " Gatera said . " 

Out of these 00 were former soldiers . 

These people are now in Gisenyi prison , " Gatera added . 

Revered skull of S. Africa king is Scottish woman 's . 

JOHANNESBURG 0000-00-00 

A <OOV> South African chief was in disgrace on Saturday after a prized skull he brought home from Scotland was identified as belonging not to his sacred tribal ancestor , but to a middle-aged white woman . 

A forensic scientist who examined the supposed skull of 00th century King Hintsa , a chief of President Nelson Mandela 's Xhosa tribe killed in battle by the British , said it was in fact the cranium of a European woman . 

Chief Nicholas Gcaleka , dressed in animal skins and full tribal regalia , journeyed to a wintry Scotland in February on a hugely publicised quest to find Hintsa 's skull . 

The witchdoctor said ancestors had appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to return the head , said to have been carried off as a colonial trophy by the officer who shot and allegedly beheaded Hintsa after a battle in 0000 . 

But Gcaleka ran into trouble as soon as he returned to South Africa with a skull he found in a cottage in a lonely Highland forest near Inverness . 

He said the spirit of a hurricane had guided him there . 

Members of the Xhosa royal family , branding Gcaleka a charlatan , confiscated the head and sent it for tests to a forensic scientist , who examined the shape of the skull and the hole that he determined had not come , as supposed , from a bullet . 

" It can be stated beyond reasonable doubt that this skull is not that of the late king , " the scientist said in a statement . 

Sudan arrests opposition sewing machine smugglers . 

KHARTOUM 0000-00-00 

Sudanese police have arrested three people trying to smuggle sewing machines and army clothing to Sudanese opposition groups in Eritrea , an official newspaper reported on Saturday . 

The government-owned <OOV> al-Watani said the smugglers were caught in Banat in the eastern state of Kassala , on the border with Eritrea , and had confessed they were on their way to " the so-called alliance forces which have been undertaking subversive operations on the eastern border " . 

Authorities in Kassala said opposition forces based in Eritrea have been laying landmines and stealing vehicles and other goods to smuggle them across the border into Eritrea . 

Sudan accuses the Eritrean authorities of providing support to Sudanese opposition elements based in Eritrea . 

Eritrea cut diplomatic ties with Sudan in 0000 , accusing it of training rebels to make raids into Eritrea . 

The exiled National Democratic Alliance , a Sudanese umbrella opposition group , has its headquarters in the Eritrean capital Asmara . 

It uses the former Sudanese embassy . 

Albanian Socialists start landmark reform congress . 

TIRANA 0000-00-00 

Albania 's opposition Socialist Party began a two-day congress on Saturday to discuss major jettisoning its links with almost half a century of Stalinist dictatorship in the Balkan country . 

" The congress will approve new concepts that will turn the party into a Social-Democratic and electoral party , not a class and ideological one , " the Socialist Zeri i Popullit daily said in an editorial . 

Jailed Socialist leader Fatos Nano made the first call for change in July , a month after the party 's chief opponents , the conservative Democrats of President Sali Berisha , almost swept the board in a disputed general election . 

The Socialists , reformed heirs to the communists , pulled out of the poll saying it was a sham . 

Acting Socialist leader Servet Pellumbi has said he too will urge the party to scrap the ideas of Karl Marx at the congress . 

The pro-reform stance of some of the party leadership initially caused a storm and triggered the resignation last month of the party 's Secretary-General Gramoz Ruci . 

More recently political commentators have reported a growing consensus , however , and a rift at the meeting looks increasingly unlikely .

MANAGUA , Nicaragua 0000-00-00

Nepal wo n't help split Tibet , king tells China . 

BEIJING 0000-00-00 

King Birendra of Nepal has told China his nation will not become the tool of people who want Tibetan independence from Beijing , the official China Daily newspaper said on Saturday . 

King Birendra , in Tibet at the start of a one-week unofficial visit to China , said the Nepalese government had " maintained a sharp vigilance against such intentions " , the newspaper said . 

Nepal shares a long mountain border with the restive Himalayan region , where opposition to Beijing 's four-decade rule is widespread . 

Chinese official media has often accused foreign forces , notably the United States , of seeking to support Tibetan independence activists . 

King Birenda told <OOV> Norbu , chairman of the Tibetan government , that Nepal would not " become a tool for others to split Tibet " , the newspaper said . 

<OOV> told the royal visitor increased cooperation between Nepal and Tibet was possible in the fields of trade , tourism , communications and sports , it said .

Iran hangs two men for drug trafficking . 

TEHRAN 0000-00-00 

Iran has hanged two drug traffickers in the southern city of Shiraz , the evening newspaper Resalat reported on Saturday . 

The two Iranian men were arrested in July with 000 kilograms ( 000 lbs ) of opium after they opened fire on police and killed a <OOV> and wounded four , the newspaper quoted a police commander as saying . 

Resalat said the executions were ordered by the Islamic Revolutionary Court . 

It did not say when they took place . 

One of the men , who killed the pedestrian , was hanged at the site of the crime and the other was executed in Adel prison in Shiraz , the newspaper said . 

Possession of 00 grammes ( just over an ounce ) of heroin or five kg ( 00 lb ) of opium is punishable by death in Iran . 

More than 0,000 people have been executed in drug-related cases since the law took effect in 0000 . 

Iran has an estimated one million drug addicts and is a key transit route for drugs , mostly opium , smuggled to Europe through Afghanistan and Pakistan -- the so called " Golden Crescent . " 

Main Tunisian opposition party ousted from HQ . 

TUNIS 0000-00-00 

Tunisia 's main opposition party on Saturday announced that it had been ousted from its headquarters building by a court decision for failing to pay the rent . 

Mohamed Ali <OOV> , spokesman for the Movement of Socialist Democrats ( MDS ) said that a bailiff who was accompagnied by policemen , on Saturday ordered the party to leave the building . 

" We were not allowed a delay to enable us to transfer the movement 's goods and documents , " <OOV> added in a statement . 

The building is state property . 

The MDS was represented in court and admitted owing money for rent but did not give details . 

MDS this year lost its president and vice-president , both of whom were tried and given jail sentences . 

MDS president Mohamed Moada was sentenced last February to 00 years in jail on charges of having secret contacts with Libyan agents and receiving money from Tripoli . 

Vice-president Khemais Chammari last July was sentenced to five years in prison on a charge of disclosing secrets of judicial proceedings in Moada 's affair . 

To replace Moada , the MDS after the trial named <OOV> as " coordinator " but Ismail <OOV> , the last of the MDS founding members still politically active , claimed the title of president , causing a new split within the movement . 

MDS was founded in 0000 by a group led by Ahmed Mestiri , who withdrew from politics in 0000 . 

Succeeding him as head of the movement , Moada , an Arab nationalist , ousted liberals led by MDS secretary-general Mustapha Ben Jaafar in 0000 . 

Kurdish group says two killed in Iraqi shelling . 

NICOSIA 0000-00-00 

An Iraqi Kurdish guerrilla group on Saturday accused Iraqi government forces of killing two civilians in shelling in northern Iraq , the Iranian news agency IRNA reported . 

IRNA said it was monitoring a report from a radio station affiliated to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) . 

" Iraqi army heavily shelled the Kanie <OOV> camp , west of Arbil , on Friday ... 

Two civilians were killed in the Iraqi bombing , " IRNA quoted the radio report as saying . 

The <OOV> radio on Friday said Iraqi heavy artillery was pounding its positions in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq but it gave no details of casualties . 

There was no independent confirmation of the reports . 

The rival Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) , which accuses Iran of supporting the PUK , said on Thursday that its forces had halted an Iranian-backed attack by thousands of PUK fighters . 

The United States said in Washington on Friday that it had brokered a ceasefire to end six days of fighting between the two main Kurdish factions and persuaded them to attend <OOV> peace talks next month . 

The clashes , shattering a ceasefire negotiated last year by Washington , had threatened a U.S.-led peace plan to unite the Kurdish region against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . 

U.S. , British and French planes have been patrolling the skies of northern Iraq since shortly after the 0000 Gulf War to shield Iraq 's Kurds from any attack by Iraqi troops . 

Iran accuses Iraq of ceasefire violations . 

NICOSIA 0000-00-00 

Iran has accused Iraq of violating the ceasefire ending their 0000-00 war some 00 times between the end of March and May 00 this year , the Iranian news agency IRNA reported on Saturday . 

Iran 's deputy representative to the United Nations , Majid Takht <OOV> , made the allegations in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday , the agency said . 

" The Islamic Republic of Iran has reported some 00 new cases of ceasefire violations by the Iraqi regime between March 00 and May 00 , 0000 , " it reported from New York .

Clinton campaign busy making " news " . 

Laurence McQuillan 

WASHINGTON 0000-00-00 

President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy " making news " -- or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year . 

With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president , Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the just-concluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole . 

After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republican-controlled Congress , Clinton used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly " announce " a development in the war on crime . 

" Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders , " Clinton said . " 

That plan has now reached my desk . " 

" Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals , not just in a single state but wherever they go , " he said . 

Actually , creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger . 

Attorney General Janet Reno 's report -- all nine pages of it , including footnotes -- offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established . 

Two months ago , Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established . 

Now , 00 days later , he had a chance to talk about it again . 

It is an example of Clinton 's strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov. 0 presidential election . 

Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House , they are part of his political chess game . 

In the past week Clinton signed into law an increase in the <OOV> wage , a bill that makes it easier for someone with a pre-existing health problem to change jobs , and sweeping changes overhauling the nation 's welfare system . 

" America can look back on a week of remarkable achievement , " Clinton said , without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the House and Senate . 

" America is on the right track offering more opportunity , demanding more responsibility , building a stronger community , the sense of shared values and stronger families , " he said in striking the theme of his coming week . 

According to a senior campaign official , Clinton " will be making a lot of news in the coming week -- something different each day . " 

Clinton departs on Sunday on a four-day train trip through West Virginia , Kentucky , Ohio , Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago . 

" He 'll make news during the day ... and then at night the attention will go to the convention , " said the campaign official . " 

We think it 'll work really well . " 

Although officials decline to say just what each day 's " news " will be , the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party 's convention . 

Each day of the trip will have a late start , so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes . 

Campaign officials then hope the day 's " news " event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a lead-in for that night 's convention programme . 

" We 'll be concentrating ... on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future , " said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry . 

McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience , he will " set out a road map " for the nation 's future -- one the president hopes guides him back to the White House for four more years . 

Hurricane expected to veer north of Caribbean . 

MIAMI 0000-00-00 

Hurricane Edouard grew stronger on Saturday as it swirled across the Atlantic Ocean , but forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said the storm would likely swing north and miss the Caribbean . 

" Edouard is getting stronger and stronger , and it already has winds of 000 mph ( 000 kph ) , " said hurricane forecaster <OOV> Avila . 

" But the good news is that all our computer models indicate Edouard is going to turn to the west-northwest on Sunday and miss the islands , " he added . 

At 00 a.m. EDT ( 0000 GMT ) , Edouard was 0,000 miles east of the Lesser Antilles and moving west at 00 mph ( 00 kph ) . 

Its exact position was latitude 00.0 north , longitude 00.0 west . 

France hands suspected ETA member to Spain . 

PARIS 0000-00-00 

France on Saturday handed a suspected member of the Basque separatist group ETA to Spanish authorities , French Interior Ministry officials said . 

Ignacio <OOV> Mugica , who had just ended a prison sentence in France , is suspected of having taken part in several guerrilla attacks in Spain . 

ETA ( Basque Homeland and Freedom ) has killed about 000 people in its campaign for an independent Basque state since the 0000s . 

German troops to remain in Bosnia for <OOV> . 

BONN 0000-00-00 

Defence Minister Volker Ruehe said that German troops would stay on in Bosnia next year as part of an international force to ensure the establishment of peace , a newspaper reported on Saturday . 

The current NATO-led peace force ( IFOR ) in Bosnia is due to return home at the end of the year . 

But Ruehe told Bild am Sonntag in an interview that a " new and different mandate " for the troops would be agreed on for next year after the current mandate expires in December . 

" After the ( Bosnian ) elections ( on September 00 ) the troops will start being reduced from the beginning of October from 00,000 to about 00,000 . 

A completely new and different mandate will be agreed for next year , " Ruehe said . 

" The defence ministers will begin negotiations for this at the beginning of September at a NATO meeting , " he told the newspaper in an interview , excerpts of which were released ahead of publication on Sunday . 

" But we must avoid giving the impression this peace deployment in former Yugoslavia is being perceived in the long run as an occupation . 

On the other hand we must prevent any return of war and massacres " he said . 

Italian comics hope <OOV> 's on Bossi . 

<OOV> , Italy 0000-00-00 

A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader Umberto Bossi next month when they lead the ancient Etruscan town of Orvieto in a mock split from Rome . 

Orvieto mayor Stefano <OOV> said the comics , including popular actor Roberto Benigni , would declare Orvieto " capital of <OOV> " on September 00 -- the day Bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from Rome . 

" We will then proceed with the annexation of Sardinia , Corsica and Cyprus , " <OOV> told reporters on Saturday . 

He said the city council would be " ironically present " when the comics made their proclamation on the same day Bossi has threatened to declare the birth of Padania , the name he has given to northern Italy . 

Orvieto , located in Umbria between Rome and Florence , was once the capital of <OOV> , an ancient federation of 00 Etruscan towns . 

" We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September 00 , " <OOV> said . 

" We want to help turn down the rhetoric in a country that borders former Yugoslavia yet in which people are still talking about secession , " he added . 

Bossi has intensified his separatist rhetoric since his Northern League party 's good showing in last April 's general election , when it took 00 percent of the vote nationally . 

He has recently dropped a drive for federalism , saying secession from Rome 's wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners . 

Italian farmer says he mutilated four women . 

VERONA , Italy 0000-00-00 

An Italian farmer accused of multiple <OOV> has confessed to mutilating the bodies of four women after having sex with them , the Italian news agency ANSA reported on Saturday . 

It quoted the lawyer of Gianfranco Stevanin as saying the 00-year-old farmer confessed on Friday to a Verona magistrate that he had killed and mutilated the women . 

ANSA said Stevanin was unable to recall how he had killed the women , remembering only that he had found them " lifeless in his arms " after having <OOV> sex with them . 

Stevanin , arrested in 0000 and jailed for three years for assaulting an Austrian prostitute , is accused of murdering five women , three of whose bodies were found near his villa outside Verona between July and December 0000 . 

Two of the corpses were identified but not the third , found headless and decomposed in a sack in a nearby canal . 

Lawyer Cesare dal Maso told ANSA that Stevanin confessed to beheading and dumping the body of a fourth woman in the nearby Adige river . 

Dal Maso declined to comment on the alleged fifth murder , saying only that " the interrogations are not over yet " with investigators . 

It said investigators believed Stevanin had suffocated them by putting plastic bags on their heads . 

Stevanin was first sentenced for assault but investigators began digging in the garden of his villa after the first body was found by a passer-by . 

Belgium asks how paedophile suspect eluded police . 

Jeremy Lovell 

BRUSSELS 0000-00-00 

Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a child-sex scandal of murder , kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout Europe . 

Recriminations built up over how the scandal 's central figure , convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux , managed to prey on children unhindered for so long . 

In just over a week two young girls have been found dead , from starvation , two have been freed from a dungeon-like secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others . 

On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at <OOV> and one at <OOV> -- both suburbs of the southern city of Charleroi . 

Both houses are owned by Dutroux . 

Belgian media speculated that Dutroux , charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children , must have had high level protection to molest youngsters . 

They put forward no proof to support the speculation , but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor Michel Bourlet on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case " if I am allowed to " . 

Bourlet said between 000 and 000 paedophile porn video tapes had been seized , some of which featured Dutroux . 

Dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around Charleroi . 

Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eight-year-old girls in another of his houses . 

Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo , had been kidnapped in June last year . 

Dutroux said they starved to death nine months later . 

He also admitted kidnapping two other girls , An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , a year ago . 

The fate of the girls is unknown , but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor . 

Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague . 

Five other people have been arrested including Dutroux 's second wife Michelle Martin , charged as an accomplice . 

The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association . 

Dutch police are also holding a 00-year old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of An and Eefje , although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established . 

At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of high-level protection for Dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling , incompetence and indifference . 

Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed " Othello " against Dutroux in 0000 -- when both Julie and Melissa and An and Eefje were kidnapped . 

They show that the gendarmes were aware that Dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children , yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was . 

They also show that police investigating a theft visited Dutroux late last year at the house where Julie and Melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children 's cries they could hear came from neighbours . 

Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a cover-up . 

There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux , an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support , managed to own six houses . 

Death toll of Algeria bomb put at <OOV> . 

PARIS 0000-00-00 

An Algerian newspaper on Saturday put at seven -- two women and five children -- the death toll of a bomb blast in a market west of Algiers on Friday . 

Algerian security forces said on Friday three women and two children were killed and five people wounded when a home-made bomb exploded at a market in the coastal town of Bou Haroun , 00 km ( 00 miles ) west of Algiers . 

The security forces also said a man carrying an explosive device also died after it went off prematurely . 

El-Watan paper said the blast killed seven -- a mother and her 00-year-old daughter , four young boys and a five-year-old girl . 

Several people were also wounded , it said . 

The explosion was the latest in series of bomb attacks in Algeria 's four-year-old civil strife . 

The government-appointed watchdog , Human Rights National Observatory , was quoted this month by local newspapers as saying about 0,000 civilians have died in bomb attacks blamed on Moslem rebels in the past two years . 

An estimated 00,000 Algerians and more than 000 foreigners have been killed in violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 0000 , when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead . 

Malta police seize cannabis among chilli sauce . 

VALLETTA 0000-00-00 

Police in Malta said on Saturday they had seized 0.0 tonnes of cannabis concealed in a shipment of chilli sauce on its way from Singapore to Romania . 

Police commissioner George Grech said the cannabis was found on Friday packed in 000 boxes hidden behind chilli sauce in a container that arrived at Malta Freeport a week ago . 

The container was on its way to Romania via the former Yugoslavia from Singapore and was the biggest drugs haul in Malta , police said . 

No street value was given for the cannabis . 

Czech coach in fatal crash in Austria . 

VIENNA 0000-00-00

Most Spaniards back talks with Basque <OOV> . 

MADRID 0000-00-00 

Most Spaniards would support government talks with the illegal Basque separatist group ETA if the rebels renounced violence permanently , a survey published in daily El Mundo on Saturday said . 

While 00 percent of the population supported negotiations with ETA ( Basque Homeland and Freedom ) , 00 percent opposed it , the survey by the state-controlled Centre for Sociological Studies ( CIS ) found . 

But 00 percent said ETA had shown little interest in achieving peace in the Basque country when it offered a one-week truce in July while continuing to hold prison officer Jose Antonio Ortega Lara , kidnapped in January . 

The problem of terrorism had neither worsened nor improved since the conservative Popular Party ( PP ) came to power in May , according to 00 percent of those questioned , while 00 percent said it had worsened . 

The survey questioned 0,000 people between July 00 and 00 and has a margin of error of plus or minus two percent . 

Thirty killed as floods plunge Lahore into chaos . 

ISLAMABAD 0000-00-00 

At least 00 people have been killed and about 000 injured in the flood-hit Pakistani city of Lahore , newspapers reported on Saturday . 

They said 000 mm ( 00 inches ) of rain had drenched the Punjab provincial capital in 00 hours , turning streets into rivers , knocking out power , water and telephone services , disrupting air and rail traffic , and sweeping away houses and cars . 

Newspapers quoted witnesses as saying they had seen bodies floating in the streets . 

Among the dead were five members of the religious <OOV> party who drowned while trying to remove books from a basement library . 

They said thousands of people had been made homeless after a breach opened in the city canal , inundating residential areas . 

Army troops were called in to evacuate residents of low-lying areas to higher ground . 

Officials said the Ravi and Chenab rivers , which both flow through Punjab , were in high flood and emergency services backed by troops were on full alert . 

Internet Startup funded to develop Java software . 

MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif. 0000-00-00 

A small team of engineers from Sun Microsystems Inc. 's JavaSoft unit said Sunday they have formed a new company , dubbed Internet Startup , to build Java infrastructure software . 

The fledgling company , established in a ground-floor office here over the last two weeks , has received venture financing from <OOV> Venture Partners of <OOV> Park , Calif .. 

David Cowan , Internet Startup founder and acting chief executive , is a general partner of <OOV> . 

The startup company 's acting chairman is Jim <OOV> , the president of RSA Data Security , a unit of Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. as well as chairman of VeriSign . 

Internet Startup , which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees , combines experience at JavaSoft , Apple Computer Inc. , and Oracle Systems . 

" Java portends dramatic changes in the way we use the Internet , " said Hong Bui , vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at JavaSoft . 

Java is a computer programming language introduced by Sun Microsystems in <OOV> which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner . 

Just last week , Sun Microsystems and the Silicon Valley venture capital giant Kleiner Perkins <OOV> & Byers said they had completed financing of a $ 000 million fund managed by Kleiner Perkins to fund <OOV> developing Java technologies . 

Java has been licensed by nearly 00 organisations , ranging from Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. to the Taiwan government . 

Prasad Wagle , another former senior JavaSoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at Internet Startup , said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications <OOV> . 

One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes , known as " <OOV> " because they are small applications , can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use . 

In this model , individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time , also saving costs of memory and storage . 

Chris <OOV> , a veteran of Apple and a former JavaSoft marketing manager , is vice president of marketing at Internet Startup , whose Web site is <OOV> . 

<OOV> has funded numerous Internet pioneers , including PSI Net , VeriSign and Individual . 

GOLF - <OOV> WINS <OOV> TITLE OF YEAR IN AKRON . 

AKRON , Ohio 0000-00-00 

Phil Mickelson birdied two of the last three holes to win World Series of Golf by three strokes over Billy Mayfair on Sunday . 

It was the fourth tournament title this year for Mickelson , who shot an even-par 00 , after being tied for the lead with Billy Mayfair with three holes to play . 

Along with <OOV> at 000 for the tournament were Steve Stricker , who had a 00 , and Duffy Waldorf , with a 00 . 

" It was very hard to sleep last night because there was so much I could accomplish with this win , " said Mickelson , who had a three-stroke lead entering the third round . " 

This was a win I wanted very , very much . " 

Mickelson 's victory gave him a 00 year exemption to the PGA Tour . 

The $ 000,000 first place check brings Mickelson back to the top of the money list with $ 0,000,000 won this year . 

" This is a major championship golf course , and for me to perform well on this style of course is a big step up for me in my career and my performance in future majors , " he said . 

Mickelson three-stroke lead was cut to two when Mayfair birdied the course 's only easy hole , the par five second hole , while Mickelson three-putted for par from 00 feet . 

On the back nine Mickelson began driving erratically , and poor tee shots resulted in bogeys on the , eighth , 00th and 00th holes , bringing Mickelson back to four under par , tied with Mayfair , who had parred 00 straight holes after the birdie on <OOV> . 

Mickelson then set up a tap in birdie on the 00th , sending a wedge shot to 00 inches . 

He had another birdie on the 00th , where he his a <OOV> to six feet . 

Mayfair bogeyed the 00th , missing a five foot par putt , and dropped from solo second place to a three way tie for second . 

It was the second successive year in which Mayfair has finished runner up in this tournament . 

He lost to Greg Norman in sudden death last year . 

The defending champion was in contention , two behind Mickelson for much of the day , until he bogeyed the 00th and 00th holes .

MOTORCYCLING - JAPANESE WIN <OOV> ROUND <OOV> <OOV> RACES . 

<OOV> , Japan 0000-00-00 

Teenager <OOV> Takeda , racing in only his first season , outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday . 

Takeda , 00 , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser , last year 's championship runner-up , with four of the 00 laps left . 

Honda 's Takeda was pursued past Corser by the Yamaha duo of Noriyuki Haga and Wataru Yoshikawa with Haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap . 

But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third . 

Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 000.000 kph . 

Corser , who crashed during practice on Friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand 00 seconds behind the winner . 

In the second race , Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki . 

Aoki , the elder brother of reigning 000cc world champion Haruchika , had a <OOV> duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag . 

Kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by Aoki , who recorded the fastest lap of 000.000 kph , and then by Takeda . 

With Takeda out of the race , Kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake Aoki . 

Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in 00th place . 

But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on 000 points , followed by Corser with 000 and Kocinski with 000 .

CRICKET - <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> CAREER WITH <OOV> . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

South African fast bowler Shaun Pollock concluded his Warwickshire career with a flourish on Sunday by taking the final three wickets during the county 's Sunday league victory over Worcestershire . 

Pollock , who returns home on Tuesday for an ankle operation , took the last three wickets in nine balls as Worcestershire were dismissed for 000 . 

After an hour 's interruption for rain , Warwickshire then reached an adjusted target of 000 with 00 balls to spare and record their fifth win in the last six games . 

Warwickshire are currently in fourth position behind Yorkshire , Nottinghamshire and Surrey . 

Yorkshire captain David Byas completed his third Sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table , reaching a career best 000 not out against Lancashire . 

Lancashire 's total of 000 for eight from 00 overs looked reasonable before Byas put their attack to the sword , collecting his runs from just 000 balls with three sixes and nine fours . 

Yorkshire eventually reached their target with only four wickets down and 0.0 overs to spare .

CRICKET - <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> AND ENGLAND <OOV> <OOV> . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

Chris Lewis did his best to forget his controversial omission from the England one-day squad on Sunday but could not prevent Pakistan reasserting their dominance in the final test at The Oval . 

A super piece of fielding by Lewis , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 00 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for England as the touring team batted on to reach 000 for five at the interval , a lead of 00 . 

The solitary wicket to fall was Asif Mujtaba , run out for 00 attempting a second run to third man where Lewis was lurking with a point to prove . 

There seemed scant danger until the Surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate Alec Stewart who whipped off the bails . 

Lewis , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as Salim Malik and Wasim Akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms . 

Wasim rattled along to 00 not out , outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on 00 at the break , although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role . 

Rain arrived just as the players left the field for lunch , forcing the ground-staff into action yet again . 

The weather delayed the resumption for over an hour , the umpires finally announcing play would start again at 0000 local time ( 0000 GMT ) .

SOCCER - CHAMPIONS PORTO KICK <OOV> <OOV> WITH A DRAW . 

LISBON 0000-00-00 

Portuguese champions Porto kicked off the season with a disappointing 0-0 home draw against Setubal and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time . 

Porto , who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season , were 0-0 down until the 00th minute when a header by Mario Jardel found the net after a string of missed opportunities , including a penalty taken by top league scorer Domingos Oliveira in the 00th minute . 

Domingos redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time . 

Setubal , who put on a skilful counter-attack throughout the game , opened the scoring 00 minutes into the match when an unmarked Chiquinho Conde shot around Porto 's new Polish keeper <OOV> Wozniak . 

Conde scored his second in the 00th minute . 

Benfica , also playing their first game of the season at home , were held to a 0-0 draw by northern side Braga despite the fact that the visitors were reduced to 00 men in the 00th minute after Rodrigo Carneiro was sent off for a second bookable offence . 

Benfica dominated the game but their lack of a first-class striker was apparent throughout and in the 00th minute they lost key Brazilian midfielder Valdo who suffered a light knee injury . 

He was substituted by Paulao . 

Benfica finally opened the scoring in the 00st minute with a penalty taken by Helder after Luis Baltasar tripped up captain Joao Pinto under the referee 's nose . 

Braga defender <OOV> gave his team their equaliser seven minutes from the final whistle with a header into the back of the net .

SOCCER - <OOV> WIN WITH <OOV> DOUBLE . 

MILAN 0000-00-00 

Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta gave Fiorentina the perfect 00th birthday present on Sunday with two goals that gave the Italian Cup winners a 0-0 Supercup victory over serie A champions Milan . 

The victory , coming on the eve of the founding of the Florence club in 0000 , also marked the first time since the pre-season trophy between the Cup winners and league champions was started in 0000 that the Cup winners had won . 

Batistuta gave Fiorentina the lead in the 00th minute . 

Sweden 's Stefan Schwarz picked him out with a lob to the edge of the box and Batistuta did the rest , chipping veteran defender Franco Baresi and scoring at the near post . 

Montenegrin midfielder Dejan Savicevic equalised for the home team , weaving past a defender , checking and firing in a left-footed shot in the 00st minute that gave young Fiorentina goalkeeper Francesco Toldo little chance . 

The scored stayed level to the final minutes but with a penalty shoot out looming , Batistuta took charge . 

French international midfielder Marcel Desailly fouled the Argentine , whose coach at Boca Juniors before he joined Fiorentina in 0000 was new Milan coach Oscar Tabarez , and Batistuta rammed home the free kick from 00 metres out . 

The 00rd minute shot , curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed Batigol by adoring Fiorentina fans , was just reward for Fiorentina who looked a far more impressive team . 

Milan 's player of the year George Weah missed a good first half opportunity but otherwise looked a little rusty while Italian team mate Roberto Baggio did not play due to injury . 

New Dutch signing Edgar Davids came on late in the second half as a Milan substitute but made little impact . 

The league season starts on September 0 .

RUGBY UNION - All Blacks relive triumph . 

PRETORIA , Aug 00 - Captain Sean Fitzpatrick and his All Blacks revisited the test venue today to relive some of the magic moments of yesterday 's momentous rugby victory over South Africa , NZPA reported . 

Most of the test 00 who beat the Springboks 00-00 to secure New Zealand 's first-ever rugby series in South Africa stood in the middle of the empty <OOV> Loftus Versfeld . 

Magnificent , ' ' said Fitzpatrick , New Zealand 's most capped player and the world 's most capped forward . 

The players relived the moves and tries , the tackles and what might have been as the emotions of victory continued . 

Zinzan Brooke , the only No 0 in test rugby to have scored a dropped goal when he kicked a three-pointer against England during last year 's World Cup , added a second to his name yesterday . 

I was right here , ' ' he said standing at the spot where he had received the ball for the kick . 

The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball . 

When ( halfback ) Justin Marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where Jon Preston was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way . 

I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there . 

It cost me a few bucks at the bar . ' 

' 

The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one , Brooke said . 

It was just like the World Cup , the ball came and the chance was there . ' 

' 

Centre Frank Bunce said he had never felt so exhausted during a match . 

We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide , they just kept coming at you , ' ' he said . 

I was gone in the first 00 minutes , completely exhausted , but you had no choice . 

There was just so much riding on it . 

It 's amazing just how big this ground was yesterday . ' 

' 

Two-try winger Jeff Wilson said he was so tired that he kept asking Bunce where he should be while defending . 

He told me I 'm buggered too so just hang in there ' , ' ' Wilson recalled . 

About 0000 New Zealander supporters were partying into the early hours of today in the South African capital . 

Messages of goodwill continued to roll into the team hotel . 

All Blacks coach John Hart said Prime Minister Jim Bolger rang him today to offer his congratulations . 

He thanked us on behalf of the country , which is really nice for the team , and I understand we had tremendous support at home . '

South Africa yet to hear from apartheid enforcers . 

Anton Ferreira 

CAPE TOWN 0000-00-00 

South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political <OOV> and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands . 

Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid . 

Most , including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers . 

But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating . 

Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee . 

" I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , " he said . " 

That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . " 

The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds . 

But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee , have yet to testify . 

Tutu 's deputy chairman , Alex Boraine , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week . 

He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called . 

But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims . 

" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee . 

At the moment this is not the case . " 

He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks . 

His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that . 

Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission . 

Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC , de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied . 

Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared : 

" This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all . 

What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . " 

Political scientist Jannie <OOV> said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in 0000 and began dismantling it in 0000 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be <OOV> through the commission . 

" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation . 

One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , " he said . 

Professor Tom Lodge of the University of the Witwatersrand demurred , saying : 

" In the irritation , in the jokes , in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission , I think there 's a moral uneasiness , and I think that 's healthy . 

Responsibility is percolating downwards . " 

Moslem refugees seek to vote in Serb-held town .

<OOV> , Bosnia 0000-00-00 

Thousands of Moslem refugees denounced Bosnia 's elections as a farce on Sunday because Serb <OOV> would be able to vote in their old home town , cementing partition of the country . 

They said they were ready to force their way back across post-war ethnic lines to Serb-held Doboj , one of several towns where NATO troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived . 

The refugees , rallying in <OOV> on government territory two km from Doboj in northeast Bosnia , waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the United Nations and the European Union . " 

We demand to vote in Doboj , " other banners said . 

Bosnia 's Moslem-led central government and many displaced Moslems are angered by a key provision of the <OOV> September 00 elections allowing people to vote in post-war " new places of residence . " 

As a result , separatist Serb authorities have packed former Moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other Serbs to vote there . 

Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate Bosnia as a single , multi-ethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition , de facto or de jure . 

" Only our physical presence in Doboj will mean that the Dayton peace treaty has truly been implemented , " Edhem <OOV> Camdzic , Doboj 's Islamic <OOV> , told the refugees . 

" The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us , " said <OOV> <OOV> , head of Doboj <OOV> . 

" Eleven thousand Serbs who came from elsewhere to Doboj will vote there . 

How can we then expect the reintegration of Bosnia ? 

But no one will stop us from returning to our homes . " 

<OOV> Komarica , a government refugee official , said : " We want to vote where we were thrown out from . 

This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible , so let them shoot . " 

Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic , a Moslem , told the refugees : " We have a message for the Serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that . " 

To loud applause , he added : " We will enter Doboj , untie the Doboj knot and ensure free movement for all . 

We have to enter Doboj to free the Serbs from their own ( separatist ) politics . " 

The Dayton peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines . 

But local police , controlled by nationalist parties in Moslem , Serb and Croat sectors of Bosnia , and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders . 

The majority of refugees from Bosnia 's 0000-00 war are Moslems from the Serb-controlled north and east . 

NATO-led peace troops beefed up their presence in the Doboj area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the Inter-Entity Boundary Line into Doboj . 

But the crowd dispersed without incident . 

Moslems and Serbs have scuffled several times along the line in the past when Moslem refugees tried to surge into the town . 

Eight killed in Moscow casino blaze . 

MOSCOW 0000-00-00 

Eight people died on Sunday in a blaze at a Moscow casino which the fire service said might have been started deliberately , Interfax news agency said . 

The number of casinos has soared in Moscow since the collapse of communism . 

The mayor has said he wants to cut their number to five as part of a war against organised crime . 

President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree on fighting crime in July and handed wide-ranging powers to security chief Alexander Lebed , currently engaged in making peace in breakaway Chechnya . 

Russian troops start pullout , but not in Grozny . 

SHATOI , Russia 0000-00-00 

Russian troops began to pull out from southern Chechnya on Sunday under a ceasefire agreement between Russian security chief Alexander Lebed and rebel leaders . 

But in the capital Grozny , the commander of Russian Interior Ministry forces in Chechnya , General Anatoly Shkirko , told Interfax news agency he was delaying a pullout of troops there after a group of Chechens disarmed an armoured column . 

Reuters cameraman <OOV> <OOV> said a column of around 00 vehicles , including tanks , armoured personnel carriers , artillery cannons and lorries , escorted by Chechen rebels , pulled out of the village of Shatoi towards the border , around 00 km ( 00 miles ) to the north . 

In Grozny , Shkirko told Interfax he was suspending the pullout of troops from the capital until weapons seized by the Chechens were returned . 

Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov confirmed the weapons had been seized but that it was a maverick group of Chechens . 

He said later that the rebels had handed them over . 

The pullout of the Russian troops is a key element of the peace plan brokered by Lebed , which aims to end the 00-month Chechnya conflict . 

Leftist Mexican armed group says troops in capital . 

MEXICO CITY 0000-00-00 

The leftist Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) in a published report on Sunday said it operated throughout Mexico , including the capital , and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state . 

Commanders " Vicente " and " Oscar " , guarded by a dozen EPR gunmen , said in an interview with La Jornada outside Mexico City that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government . 

" They ( government officials ) want to present us before public opinion as a local problem , as just being from Guerrero and as irrational radicals , " Commander Oscar told La Jornada . 

They said the ERP , whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of Guerrero on June 00 , had a <OOV> membership , but this could not be confirmed independently . 

La Jornada also reported on Sunday that the Mexican Army has discovered a <OOV> , EPR manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies . 

It quoted the manual as saying : " The objective of the Basic Course on War is to provide for combatants of the EPR basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie . " 

It was the second time armed " commanders " of the EPR have granted interviews outside Guerrero state , an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities . 

Unlike the better known and unrelated Zapatista rebels in southeastern Chiapas state , the EPR has never taken on the army in direct combat , according to official reports . 

There have only been a few skirmishes in Guerrero in which a handful of police , soldiers and civilians have been killed or injured . 

Ten people gunned down in northwest Colombia . 

BOGOTA , Colombia 0000-00-00 

Unidentified gunmen dragged 00 men out ot their homes in a rural area of Colombia 's northwest province of Antioquia and shot them to death , authorities said on Sunday . 

Police said the killings occurred on Saturday morning in the municipality of Anza but news of the massacre only reached the provincial capital of Medellin early on Sunday . 

Anza is only 00 miles ( 00 km ) west of Medellin , but there are no roads linking it directly to the city . 

Police initially said leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) rebels were prime suspects in the killings . 

But gunmen of the left and right have killed with impunity across Antioquia for years , and there were unconfirmed reports that the latest bloodshed was the work of a right-wing paramilitary group .

Two Thai border police wounded by Burma gunmen . 

MAE SOT , Thailand 0000-00-00 

Two Thai border policemen were seriously wounded on Sunday when members of a Burmese rebel splinter faction ambushed their patrol in northwest Thailand , security officers said . 

The two were wounded in the early hours of Sunday when some 00 members of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army ( DKBA ) ambushed their patrol on the Thai side of the border with Burma , to the north of the town of Mae Sot . 

The Thai army commander in the area , Col Suvit <OOV> , told reporters the DKBA , which is allied with the Rangoon military government and based in southeast Burma , had recently stepped up cross-border infiltration . 

Suvit said the motive for their intrusions was not clear but he had ordered reinforcements to beef up security along the porous frontier . 

The DKBA was formed in late 0000 by hundreds of guerrillas who split from the anti-Rangoon Karen National Union ( KNU ) and allied themselves with Burmese government army , their former enemies . 

DKBA members have since launched intermittent cross-border attacks on Karen refugee camps in Thailand , where the majority of inhabitants are KNU supporters , and on Thai villages and police posts near the border . 

Bangkok has complained to Rangoon about the raids but Burmese military authorities say they have no contol over the faction . 

Thai army commanders reject the explanation , saying they have evidence the Burmese army supplies and directs the renegade ethnic minority splinter faction .

" A U.S. <OOV> military plane while landing at Ben Gurion airport blew a wheel and a fire broke out , " said spokesman Yehiel Amitai , adding that the two pilots on board were not injured . 

" Airport officials declared an emergency situation at the highest level and the fire brigade put out the flames while the plane was landing , " he said . 

Egypt hopes jars will reveal secrets of mummies . 

CAIRO 0000-00-00 

Archaeologists in Egypt have found pots used by ancient Egyptians in burial rites that they say may reveal the secrets of mummification . 

Mohammed Saleh , director of the Egyptian Museum , told Reuters television a U.S. team found the pots , some of which contain human intestines , in a tomb built into the rocks while digging in Dahshour , a village 00 km ( 00 miles ) south of Cairo . 

Dahshour is the site of Egypt 's second largest pyramid , built for the pharaoh <OOV> more than 0,000 years ago . 

Saleh said the team -- from New York 's Metropolitan Museum -- found four <OOV> jars and two <OOV> jars in the tomb , which belongs to an unidentifed person who lived during the 00th Dynasty ( 0000-0000 BC ) in the Middle Kingdom . 

" This finding is important because one of the jars still contains substances and materials used in the conservation of mummies and the conservation of the intestines and all the things which were in the cavity of a person we have not identified yet , " Saleh said . 

" We hope that the analysis of such substances and liquids will reveal some secrets of the mummification process and materials used in this process , " he added .

Netanyahu , Weizman consult on Arafat invitation . 

JERUSALEM 0000-00-00 

Israeli President Ezer Weizman , weighing a possible meeting with Yasser Arafat , consulted on Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , a spokesman said . 

Weizman and Netanyahu met at the president 's official Jerusalem residence and planned to speak to the media at the end of their talks , the prime minister 's spokesman said . 

Earlier , the director of the president 's office denied a report in Israel 's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that Weizman had already invited Arafat to his private home for talks in the coming week on the future of the Israel-PLO peace process . 

But the official , Aryeh <OOV> , said it was only fitting that Weizman and Arafat should talk after the Palestinian leader sent the Israeli president a letter which Yedioth Ahronoth reported contained an emotional appeal to save the peace proces . 

The newspaper said Netanyahu , who is cool to meeting Arafat himself , opposed talks between Weizman and the Palestinian president . 

After Moslem suicide bombers killed 00 people in Israel in February and March , Weizman called for peace efforts with the PLO to be suspended . 

<OOV> said his current position was that the peace process must continue .

Israeli president invites Arafat to home - paper . 

JERUSALEM 0000-00-00 

Israeli President Ezer Weizman has invited Yasser Arafat to meet him at his private home , Israel 's biggest newspaper said on Sunday . 

The Yedioth Ahronoth daily reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who has said he has no desire to hold talks with the Palestinian president , opposes the meeting due to be held this coming week . 

The newspaper said Weizman scheduled the meeting at his private residence in the central Israeli village of Caesarea after Arafat sent him an emotional appeal " to save the peace process " . 

Netanyahu met Weizman last Tuesday and voiced his opposition , Yedioth said . 

" I am prepared to postpone the meeting under one condition -- that you give me a commitment right now to meet Arafat yourself within 00 days , " the paper quoted Weizman as telling Netanyahu . 

It said Netanyahu had yet to give Weizman an answer . 

The office of Israeli president is largely ceremonial . 

But Weizman , a former defence minister and an architect of Israel 's peace treaty with Egypt , has spoken out frequently on the peace process with the Palestinians -- at times urging the former Labour government to slow it down . 

Corporate America taking new view on compensation . 

Anne Murray 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Corporate America is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years , according to a recent study . 

What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely . 

But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less . 

The survey , conducted in late 0000 and the early part of this year by management consulting firm Towers Perrin , showed that the focus will be on an employee 's overall value to the company 's bottom line -- rather than how well an employee performs a specific task . 

Presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said Sandra O'Neal , a Towers Perrin principal . 

In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on " knowledge , skill and abilities , " she said . 

In addition to using accounting skills , the accountant will also have to be creative , work well in a team , be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals . 

" The good news is , if you 're highly skilled and have many abilities , you 'll be paid more , " said O'Neal . 

" The bad news is , if you 're not skilled and ca n't contribute to a team , to customer service and the organisation 's goals , you 'll be paid less . " 

Of the 000 <OOV> size corporations surveyed , 00 percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years , and more than two-thirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result . 

Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure , and 00 percent report that they are considering a new , <OOV> plan for both management and <OOV> employees . 

This coming shift , O'Neal said , " is not just isolated or a fad . 

It 's an inexorable change . " 

After World War II , corporations adopted a " military model " creating hierarchical organisations where " the concept of defined tasks worked great , " she said . 

But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex . 

" <OOV> kept management at a distance from its customers , " O'Neal said . 

Now organisations must change to stay competitive . 

O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises . 

If your team does well , you 'll do well . 

If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise . 

Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ? 

" That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , " said O'Neal . " 

It 's not a question we ask any more . 

The more important question is -- ' Do we have results ? ' 

" 

To get those results , 00 percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives , such as employee and team award programmes and education . 

Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , O'Neal said . 

For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as " high-performing " companies , based on their return on equity above 00 percent . 

Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success . 

" They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , " O'Neal said . 

" The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership . 

It will improve a company 's bottom line . " 

Belgian police arrest detective in Dutroux affair . 

Geert de Clercq 

NEUFCHATEAU , Belgium 0000-00-00 

Investigators arrested a senior police detective on Sunday in connection with their inquiries into Belgium 's child sex scandal , Public Prosecutor Michel Bourlet said . 

" Georges Zicot was arrested and will be charged with truck theft , insurance fraud and document forgery , " Bourlet told a news conference . 

He said there had been searches at three sites on Sunday , including one at the Charleroi judicial police headquarters where Zicot worked . 

Zicot , 00 , is a specialist in tackling vehicle theft . 

Belgian media reported that he had been questioned twice in the past two years about thefts but released both times . 

He was promoted to chief detective earlier this year . 

Bourlet said two other people had also been arrested . 

One was Gerard <OOV> , the owner of a warehouse where stolen vehicles were allegedly stored . 

The other was insurer Thierry <OOV> . 

Bourlet said the investigation into the vehicle theft ring would be added to the inquiry into the paedophile sex scandal in which five other people have already been arrested . 

He said the connection was through Bernard Weinstein , an accomplice of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux -- the central figure in the paedophile scandal that has sent shockwaves across Europe . 

Weinstein was found dead last weekend alongside the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in a house belonging to <OOV> , who said they starved to death earlier this year , nine months after being abducted in June 0000 . 

Two other girls have been rescued and police are hunting for at least two more who Dutroux has admitted kidnapping a year ago . 

" Dutroux has admitted killing Weinstein after a disagreement between the accomplices in an affair of truck theft , " Bourlet said . 

Another four people were also questioned at the weekend but had not been detained , Bourlet added . 

Anne Thily , public prosecutor in the eastern city of Liege where Julie and Melissa lived , said this was a major case involving some 00 investigators -- including two from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation .

MUZAFFARABAD , Pakistan 0000-00-00 

A bus fell from a mountain road into a river in <OOV> Azad ( free ) Kashmir on Sunday , killing at least 00 people and injuring 00 , police said . 

They said dead included five refugees from the Indian-ruled part of Kashmir , where Moslem militants have waged a separatist revolt since early 0000 .

North Afghan highway opening put off , radio says . 

ISLAMABAD 0000-00-00 

The planned reopening of Afghanistan 's main northern Salang highway as a result of peace talks with an opposition alliance has been put off until Wednesday , official Kabul Radio said on Sunday . 

The embattled Afghan government said last week that the <OOV> highway would be opened on Monday or Tuesday following talks with the Supreme Coordination Council alliance led by <OOV> movement of powerful opposition warlord General Abdul Rashid Dostum . 

The radio said on Sunday the postponement of the opening had been made due to " precautions " . 

It did not elaborate . 

The Salang highway , Afghanistan 's main route to Central Asia , has been controlled by Dostum since he began fighting President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government in Kabul in January 0000 in alliance with <OOV> party leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , then prime minister but rival to the president . 

Hekmatyar rejoined the government as prime minister last June under a peace pact with Rabbani and has since been trying to persuade other opposition factions to follow suit . 

Earlier this month , Jumbish denied a Kabul government statement that the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire in the north . 

Students burn Hasina effigy , battle police . 

Anis Ahmed 

DHAKA 0000-00-00 

Students backed by opposition parties battled police and burned an effigy of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during a strike in the north Bangladeshi town of Bogra on Sunday . 

The strikers barricaded streets , attacked the local office of the ruling Awami League , fought running battles with police and set alight hundreds of copies of the popular " Janakantha " newspaper , alleging it was pro-government . 

Police used batons and teargas to try to disperse students who were throwing stones and home-made bombs , witnesses said . 

The strike , called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) , to denounce the deaths of four students killed by police over the last few days , coincided with a visit to the area by Hasina . 

Local officials said one policeman was killed by gunshots during clashes with pro-opposition students on Thursday . 

Hasina told a cross section of people at the Bogra police headquarters on Sunday that the government had already suspended three police officers and ordered a judicial probe into the violent incidents . 

The prime minister offered financial grants to the families of those killed , ordered the best possible medical care for the injured and urged Bogra residents to call off the strike . 

Opposition legislators walked out of parliament in Dhaka on Sunday denouncing " unprecedented police barbarity " against opposition students and supporters . 

They renewed their call for the resignation of Home ( Interior ) Minister Rafiqul Islam . 

Hundreds of police raided the Dhaka university on Sunday , arresting nearly 00 outsiders who had been living in student dormitories and seizing weapons , university officials said . 

Police stormed ten residence halls on the campus , flushed out people at gunpoint and searched their baggage . 

They seized revolvers , sawn-off rifles , shotguns and knives . 

The students were later allowed to return . 

The swoop followed the resignation of the university 's Vice-Chancellor Dr. Emajuddin Ahmed on Saturday over the deteriorating law and order situation on the campus . 

Authorities closed down the <OOV> university on Wednedsay following gunbattles between students and police . 

Police said they fought armed activists from the BNP , headed by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia . 

Hasina told police the home ministry had already given a " blanket order " to arrest terrorists and <OOV> of illegal firearms irrespective of their political identities . 

Nearly 000 students have been injured in the clashes in Dhaka and Bogra , police told reporters .

FEATURE - Fertile Ukraine faces drought of cash and rain .

<OOV> <OOV> FARM , Ukraine 0000-00-00 

Four shiny new <OOV> John Deere combines parked at this <OOV> ( <OOV> ) farm in the <OOV> regions south of Kiev do n't fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm . 

" They did a good job this year , but they need good diesel and good engine oil , " said Ivan Odnosum . " 

God help us if there is a breakdown , " he said of the machinery , loaned to the farm after the Ukrainian government bought it earlier this year . 

The country 's grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than 00 percent to only 00 million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame . 

A drought scoured the steppes in May and June , stunting the growing wheat . 

And the farming sector , making the painful transition from Soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money . 

Ukraine 's black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as " rich enough to grow rubber boots " . 

But recently Ukraine has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of Europe , earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin . 

" The wheat will not be of a good quality this year , " said <OOV> <OOV> , a scientist at the <OOV> Wheat Institute , run by the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences . 

" The temperature on the ground reached 00 decrees Celsius ( 000.00 Fahrenheit ) this summer . 

We 've never seen anything so bad , " he said in an interview in his office , unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills . 

The harvest is gathered in the dry areas , but rainfall in Western Ukraine has delayed harvesting there . 

While <OOV> 's scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to Ukraine 's extreme continental climate , <OOV> said the lack of cash in Ukraine 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought . 

Collective farms and Ukraine 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed . 

This year 's harvest is down from last year 's 00.0 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 00 million tonnes in 0000 , the year before independence . 

The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful Soviet times , when the Kremlin imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs . 

" Agriculture is very expensive , and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon , " said Odnosum . 

He said his farm , its 000 workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing , expected the land to yield 0.0 tonnes per hectare ( 0.0 acres ) but ended up with 0.0 tonnes -- still better than the national average of 0.00 tonnes per hectare this year . 

" We did not have money for fertiliser , we 're in debt for fuel , and we 're borrowing diesel , " Odnosum said . 

A few kilometres ( miles ) down the two-lane road which passes Odnosum 's farm , where the occasional horse-drawn buggy passes by , is the <OOV> ( <OOV> ) Shevchenko collective farm , built next to a village still neat and tidy despite post-Soviet decay . 

Chief Accountant Natalya <OOV> said the collective is strapped for cash , earlier this year bartering 000 tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance . 

The average family earns 000-000 million karbovanets a year ( $ 000 - $ 0,000 ) -- but many have not been paid in months , <OOV> said . " 

People are working out of their own dedication . " 

<OOV> said the farm sector has two options : " We can sit down and cry , or we can do something . " 

He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year . 

<OOV> in late summer and early autumn , the grain is Ukraine 's largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in Ukraine 's soil . 

Further plans , he said , called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for 00 percent of Ukraine 's arable land next year , for 00 percent in 0000 and 000 percent of the land in 0000 . 

" If we follow this we 'll be able to sell 00 million tonnes of grain by the year 0000 , " <OOV> said . 

The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector , and in a move back to <OOV> days has given up to 00 hectares ( 000 acres ) of land to some 00,000 private farmers willing to go it alone . 

Collective farms will last for the next few years , because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell , said one private farmer : " In the future , maybe , but it 's better not to hurry . 

" <OOV> brought us a lot of pain . 

And it went too fast . 

Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome . " 

Gencor swells profit despite setbacks . 

Melanie <OOV> 

JOHANNESBURG 0000-00-00 

Gencor Ltd on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks . 

Announcing the group 's results for the year ended June 00 , chairman Brian Gilbertson said : " Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar . " 

Gencor raised attributable earnings to 0,000 million rand from 0,000 million rand previously - in dollar terms an increase to $ 000 million from $ 000 million - and won despite the group 's Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd posting dismal results . 

" Not everything has gone well . 

We 've had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations . 

The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at Impala where we had the furnace failure , " Gilbertson said . 

<OOV> posted year attributable profit of 000 million rand from 000 million previously . 

Not only did the company lock in 0.00 rand per dollar in February / March , but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August . 

The rand was last bid at 0.0000 against the dollar . 

Nor was <OOV> the only operation to fail output targets . 

<OOV> Coal Corporation Ltd was hit hard by heavy rains . 

It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in <OOV> province . 

But Gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the European Commission 's blocking of <OOV> ' proposed merger with Lonrho Plc 's platinum interests . 

" The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger . 

From Gencor 's perspective we are taking the position that it is not on , " Gilbertson said . 

Looking ahead to the current financial year , he said that Gencor would boost earnings further . 

" Gencor is well placed to take up the challenges of the future . 

The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of world-class businesses . 

I think we can look forward to further growth " . 

Citing the disposal of Gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group <OOV> Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets . 

" We 've tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of non-core assets . 

The biggest of those was <OOV> . 

Overall a very substantial pruning ... 

leaving Gencor clearly structured along commodity lines , " Gilbertson said . 

He added that the group still had about 00 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required . 

Referring to Gencor 's increased 00.0 percent stake in <OOV> , Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more . 

" I think we would have liked to have more of <OOV> but it 's the question of adding value . 

When we bought the shares we bought ... 

at quite a bit lower than the price is now ... 

maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal . " 

Finally , Gilbertson said a growing proportion of Gencor 's income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments .

Advanced Medical buying IVAC Medical . 

SAN DIEGO 0000-00-00 

Advanced Medical Inc. said Monday it will buy IVAC Medical Systems Inc. , a former Eli Lilly & Co . 

unit , for about $ 000 million in cash , creating one of the world 's largest makers of intravenous infusion therapy products . 

Under the agreement , IVAC and Advanced Medical 's wholly owned subsidiary , IMED Corp. , will merge to form a new company that will develop and manufacture infusion pumps that regulate the amount of intravenous fluid being administered to a patient , as well as proprietary disposable products . 

The combined company will have estimated revenues of $ 000 million . 

Advanced Medical , through IMED , is already one of the nation 's largest developers and manufacturers of intravenous infusion pumps and proprietary disposable products . 

It has sales in 00 foreign countries . 

San Diego-based IVAC is a major provider of infusion systems and related technologies to the health-care industry . 

It has manufacturing plants in San Diego ; <OOV> , N.C. ; Hampshire , England ; and Tijuana , Mexico , and distributes its prodcuts in more than 000 countries . 

Eli Lilly sold IVAC on Dec. 00 , 0000 to DLJ Merchant Banking Partners LP , River Medical Inc. and other investors . 

Advanced Medical said it expects to take an unspecified one-time charge to pay for the merger . 

It did not say when the charge would be taken . 

" The addition of IVAC is expected to contribute to financial results in the full second quarter of 0000 , " the companies said . 

The merger will add to both companies ' historical leadership in infusion therapy and technology-based drug delivery devices , they said . 

In 0000 , IVAC introduced the world 's first infusion therapy monitoring device . 

A year later IVAC improved its system with the addition of an IV pump that regulated the flow of liquids through positive pressure . 

IMED introduced the world 's first <OOV> infusion pump in 0000 . 

IMED had profits of $ 0.0 million , or 0 cents per fully diluted common share , on $ 00.0 million in revenues in the first half of 0000 . 

Excluding the effect of a one-time restructuring charge of $ 00.0 million , IVAC had net income of $ 0.0 million on net sales of $ 000.0 million for the 0000 first half . 

Advanced Medical reported profits of $ 0.0 million on sales of $ 00.0 million in the quarter ended June 00 . 

William J. Mercer , IVAC president and chief executive officer , will become the president and CEO of Advanced Medical . 

He led the transition of IVAC to a privately held company and was previously senior vice president at <OOV> Group Inc . 

Joseph Kuhn , Advanced Medical and IMED president , will become the new company 's executive vice president and chief financial officer . 

The deal is expected to close by the first quarter of 0000 , subject to regulatory approval . 

It has already been approved by both companies ' boards .

RUGBY LEAGUE - ST HELENS <OOV> SUPER LEAGUE TITLE . 

ST HELENS , England 0000-00-00 

St Helens completed their first league and Challenge Cup double in 00 years on Monday when they thrashed Warrington 00-00 to clinch the inaugural Super League title . 

St Helens secured the two points they needed in the last game of the season at Knowsley Road to win their first championship since 0000 and their first double since 0000 . 

In rain-soaked conditions , centre Alan Hunte grabbed a hat-trick of tries , while Tommy Martyn , Anthony Sullivan and Paul Newlove each scored two . 

Captain and goalkicker Bobbie Goulding scored 00 points . 

St Helens 's triumph marked the end of Wigan 's seven-year reign as British champions . 

St Helens needed to win on Monday to take the title -- a defeat or draw would have allowed Wigan their eighth consecutive championship . 

They were also the toast of London Broncos , who managed to scrape into the top four ahead of Warrington and qualify for the end-of-season play-offs . 

Bradford finished third . 

St Helens have now set their sights on taking the treble by winning the end-of-season premiership which begins with next Sunday 's semifinal against London .

JYVASKYLA , Finland 0000-00-00 

Tommi Makinen took a significant step towards becoming world rally champion with a brilliant victory in the 0000 Lakes Rally on Monday . 

Mitsubishi driver Makinen stopped experienced fellow Finn Juha Kankkunen in his tracks on the final day of the <OOV> rally , doubling his lead on the first two decisive stages . 

" This was the most difficult win - three days at 000 percent effort , " said Makinen , whose success completed his 0,000 Lakes hat-trick . 

Kankkunen was runner-up in his Toyota as Finland 's Jarmo Kytolehto produced a remarkable drive to finish third in his Ford . 

Swede Kenneth Eriksson kept Subaru in the hunt for the manufacturers ' title with fifth place in spite of a gearbox problem that nearly forced him off the road close to the end of the event . 

<OOV> 's and Mitsubishi 's positions were strengthened by the late retirement of Spain 's Carlos Sainz when his Ford gearbox failed . 

Makinen , with 00 points , now leads his nearest championship rival , Sainz , by 00 points .

SOCCER - <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> TO <OOV> PRESSURE ON LEEDS . 

LEEDS , England 0000-00-00 

Winger Lee Sharpe hit a superb strike from the edge of the penalty area to give Leeds their first win of the season on Monday and leave hapless Wimbledon anchored at the bottom of the England premier league . 

Sharpe repaid a huge slice of the 0.0 million pound ( $ 0.00 million ) fee Leeds handed Manchester United for his services with a top-draw second-half goal to hand Wimbledon their third successive defeat . 

Ian Rush , the Welsh striker signed from Liverpool in the close season , set up the goal , feeding Sharpe as he galloped forward and the former England winger cut inside onto his <OOV> right foot to arc a shot into the right-hand corner of the net . 

The only goal of the match also brought some relief for under-fire Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson following the team 's poor start to the season . 

Home fans frequently booed their own side until Sharpe turned the jeers to cheers .

JOHANNESBURG 0000-00-00 

The tiny islands of the Seychelles failed to make soccer history at the weekend when they bowed out of the preliminary rounds of the African Nations Cup . 

Trailing fellow Indian Ocean islanders Mauritius 0-0 from the first leg , they were held to a 0-0 draw at home on Saturday despite playing against 00 men for most of the match . 

The 0-0 aggregate took Mauritius into the group phase of the qualifiers for the 0000 finals , and kept up the Seychelles ' record of never having won an official match in their 00 years of FIFA membership . 

The Seychelles must have thought they were on course for a historic breakthrough when Mauritian midfielder Andre <OOV> was sent off for a crude tackle in the 00th minute . 

But the visitors responded to the setback immediately -- veteran striker Ashley <OOV> scoring a minute later to give them a two-goal aggregate lead . 

Although Danny Rose 's <OOV> equaliser gave the Seychellois renewed hope they could not find the net again and were eliminated . 

Mauritius now play in group seven of the qualifiers against Malawi , Mozambique and favourites Zambia . 

Namibia , who drew 0-0 with Botswana in their first leg , won the second leg in Windhoek 0-0 to stretch their unbeaten run to eight matches and continue their remarkable progress on the African soccer stage . 

They now play in group five with Cameroon , Gabon and Kenya . 

German-based striker Bachirou Salou returned home to Togo to score the decisive only goal of their tie against Congo . 

Salou , who plays for MSV Duisburg in the Bundesliga , scored in the 00rd minute of Sunday 's match in Lome for a 0-0 aggregate win which takes his side into group six , where they will meet Liberia , Tanzania and Zaire . 

Ethiopia needed a penalty shoot-out in Addis Ababa to overcome Uganda after a 0-0 aggregate scoreline . 

Both legs ended 0-0 before Ethiopia won the spot kick decider 0-0 . 

Uganda 's elimination follows their humiliating 0-0 aggregate defeat by Angola in June 's World Cup qualifying preliminaries . 

The other preliminary round second leg match , between Mauritania and Benin in Nouakchott , was postponed until Friday . 

Benin won the first leg 0-0 .

SWIMMING - <OOV> IN <OOV> <OOV> ' AFTER <OOV> . 

MOSCOW 0000-00-00 

Russian double Olympic swimming champion Alexander Popov was in a serious condition on Monday after being stabbed on a Moscow street . 

A doctor said it was too early to say whether Popov , the only man to retain the Olympic 00 and 000 metres freestyle titles , would return to top-level sport . 

" His condition is serious , " said Rimma Maslova , deputy chief doctor of Hospital No 00 in the Russian capital . " 

But he is conscious and is talking and smiling . " 

Maslova told Reuters she was not an expert in sports medicine , but said it was too early to judge Popov 's chances of returning to competitive swimming . 

Popov , who won gold in the 00 and 000 metres freestyle at the recent Atlanta Olympics , was stabbed in the abdomen late on Saturday after an argument with a group of roadside watermelon sellers in south-west Moscow . 

Maslova said the wound had affected a lung and a kidney . 

Doctors operated on Popov , 00 , for three hours . 

Popov told NTV television on Sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly . " 

There 's no need to worry . 

We 're going to be walking soon -- and swimming , " he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit . 

Interfax news agency said police had detained one of the attackers . 

It said the row started when Popov and a group of his friends were returning from a party . 

Vitaly Smirnov , president of the Russian National Olympic Committee , said President Boris Yeltsin had given the swimmer Russia 's top award for his Olympic performance . " 

I am not a doctor but I think he is doing all right , " said Smirnov . 

Smirnov said the Olympic Committee might ask the government to take measures to protect the country 's best athletes , some of whom have already chosen to live abroad for fear of a surge in crime in post-Soviet Russia .

SOCCER - PLAYERS <OOV> MATCH EARLY TO <OOV> PLANE . 

Brian <OOV> 

RIO DE JANEIRO 0000-00-00 

Two key players left a Brazilian championship match early on Sunday because they had to catch a plane to Russia to play with the national team . 

Sao Paulo midfielder Andre and Santos defender Narciso were both substituted during their teams ' game , taken to Sao Paulo airport and flown to Rio de Janeiro in a private jet chartered by the Brazilian Football Confederation ( CBF ) . 

At Rio , they joined up with the national team squad for the journey to Moscow , where Brazil will face Russia in a friendly international on Wednesday . 

The problem arose because the Sao <OOV> clash was selected as the day 's televised live match , forcing it to be put back three hours from the usual kickoff time . 

Santos suffered more from their loss as Narciso 's replacement Jean gave away a penalty from which Sao Paulo scored the decisive goal in a 0-0 win . 

Sao Paulo lead the first stage of the championship on goal difference from surprise package Juventude , who beat Internacional 0-0 . 

Corinthians , who played in a tournament in Spain last week , also faced a plane marathon as they attempted to keep up with a hectic fixture list . 

They were due to leave Spain Monday night , arrive in Sao Paulo on Tuesday morning , catch another plane to the southern city of Curitiba one hour later and then play away to Atletico Paranaense in the Brazilian championship the same evening . 

Botafogo striker Tulio , who was overlooked by Zagalo for the tour which also features a game away to the Netherlands on Sunday , scored his third goal in three games as the defending champions beat Bahia 0-0 away . 

Tulio , who has been top-scorer in the competition for the last two seasons , has been struggling against injury for most of this year .

TENNIS - <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> - IF YOU CAN <OOV> IT AT U.S. OPEN . 

Bill <OOV> 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

A message on television monitors all around the National Tennis Centre reads : " Due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids " -- sound advice until you check out the price of fluids . 

Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding : " <OOV> bring plenty of money . " 

A small bottle of a <OOV> sports drink at the sun-drenched U.S. Open is going for $ 0.00 , while a litre of basic , life-sustaining water will set you back $ 0.00 -- for water ? 

" At the Olympics water was only a dollar , and that was the Olympics , " said one incredulous fan , noting that the Atlanta Games had been notorious for price gouging . 

U.S. Open officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw . 

When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans ' turn to be offended . 

" That baked <OOV> better be good for $ 0.00 , " said New Yorker Rebecca Weinstein , a U.S. Open regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home . 

A trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the <OOV> money pronounced it good , but Carol Perry chimed in , " The water is ridiculous , they want four dollars for the water , you might as well get a glass of wine . " 

Indeed , a nice glass of chardonnay or white <OOV> was going for $ 0.00 , while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at $ 0.00 . 

What 's the message here ? " 

Maybe they want us to be alcoholics , " Perry joked before lifting her glass of wine . 

Fans will be shelling out $ 00.00 for a hamburger and a large french fries . 

And that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty . 

Make that $ 00.00 . 

Even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping $ 0.00 . 

Of course , it is served on a <OOV> roll . 

It must be the cost of flying those rolls over from Tuscany every day that drives up the price of the sandwich . 

TENNIS - <OOV> AND <OOV> <OOV> , <OOV> <OOV> AT OPEN .

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Martina Hingis led a youthful charge and Australian Open finalist Anke Huber and Magdalena Maleeva were fallen seeds on Monday in a hot , sunny opening to the U.S. Open tennis championships . 

The 00-year-old Hingis , seeded 00th , was honoured to play the first match of the season 's last Grand Slam on Stadium Court but happy to hurry off with a straight-sets victory over the <OOV> Angeles Montolio of Spain . 

" It was very hot and I did n't want to stay long on the court , " said a cheery Hingis , who had no worries in racing to a 0-0 0-0 victory against the overmatched Spaniard . 

Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at Flushing Meadows were the sixth-seeded Huber of Germany and 00th seed Maleeva of Bulgaria . 

Huber , who lost to Monica Seles in the Australian Open final , fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater Amanda Coetzer of South Africa . 

Coetzer , ranked 00th , avenged her defeat to Huber in the Australian Open semifinals by winning 0-0 0-0 0-0 . 

" I looked at it as not a first round match , just a great challenge for me , " said Coetzer , 00 . " 

I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm . 

" She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down . 

She played one great game and than a few errors . 

The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game . " 

Huber , who reached the final a week ago at Manhattan Beach , could only mourn her luck of the draw . 

" I was n't happy when I saw the draw . 

She was the first <OOV> seeded player , " said the 00-year-old German . " 

It 's always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam . 

" I think I did n't play that bad today . 

It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played . " 

Monday brought the best out in U.S. Open rookie Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , ranked 000th . 

The 00-year-old Olsza , last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing Maleeva 0-0 0-0 . 

The curtain-raising victories by Hingis and Olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women 's players coming up from the junior ranks . 

The Swiss teenager , a twice French Open junior champion and a Wimbledon juniors winner , had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year 's Australian Open . 

" I hope I can get into the last 00 , " said Hingis , seeded to face third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the fourth round . 

Hingis has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds ( 0.0 kilos ) in advance of the championships . 

" There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there , " she said . " 

Then we 'll see if Arantxa will be there , too . " 

The fast-moving Olsza , 00 , was cool in her opening match . 

" I was n't scared when I heard that I was playing Maleeva , " said Olsza . " 

I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I ca n't be scared . " 

Olsza is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros . 

" In terms of tennis , I think the junior players are really good now . 

In a few years , it could change a lot among the top players . " 

Two big-serving women 's players made quick work of Japanese opponents . 

Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of the Netherlands , the 00th seed , was a 0-0 0-0 winner over Japan 's Nana <OOV> , while Czech veteran Helena Sukova prevailed over Yone Kamio 0-0 0-0 . 

Austrian Barbara Paulus , seeded 00th , also reached the second round with a 0-0 0-0 victory over Yi Jing-Qian of China . 

TENNIS - STICH <OOV> HE <OOV> AFTER OPEN VICTORY . 

Richard Finn 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas . 

" I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , ' " said Stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week . 

" But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . " 

In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of <OOV> toward U.S. players . 

One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion <OOV> Kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to Russia . 

Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury . 

At a news conference attended by approximately 00 players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings . 

" The way the U.S. Open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , " Martin said . 

Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest . 

" I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA . 

They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , " said Stich . " 

I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . " 

But once the 00-year-old Stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam . 

He took a positive first step with his 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court . 

Others advancing early on Monday included <OOV> American Malivai Washington , the Wimbledon runner-up , Sweden 's Magnus Gustafsson , and two-time former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain , who will be Stich 's next opponent . 

The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players . 

" I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players , " said Stich , who lost the 0000 Open final to Andre Agassi . 

It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday . 

The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six . 

" He ( Agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , " said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi , who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon . 

Stich , not seeded here for the first time since 0000 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew . 

Ranked 00th in the world , Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla , who is 00th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally . 

But Stich did n't want to play that game . 

" I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 00 deserves to be seeded , " Stich said .

BASEBALL - BONDS ' CONSECUTIVE GAME <OOV> ENDS . 

SAN FRANCISCO 0000-00-00 

San Francisco Giants All-Star left fielder Barry Bonds did not appear in Sunday 's 0-0 victory over the Montreal Expos , ending his consecutive games streak . 

After appearing as a pinch-hitter in the previous two games , Bonds , who has been battling a hamstring injury , did not see any action today , ending his streak at 000 consecutive games . 

It was the second-longest streak by an active player in the the majors behind Baltimore 's Cal Ripken , who appeared in his major-league record <OOV> straight game today , a 00-0 loss to the California Angels . 

Bonds has been limited to a pinch-hitting role since an MRI Friday showed a mild strain of his left hamstring . 

Bonds came out of Wednesday 's game against New York in the ninth inning after suffering a mild hamstring strain . 

He was back in the starting lineup Thursday night and went 0-for-0 before exiting in the third inning . 

The 00-year-old Bonds is hitting .000 with 00 homers and 000 RBI and has been one of the few bright spots for the last-place Giants . 

Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa had the third-longest streak at 000 games , but that ended earlier this week when he suffered a broken bone in his right hand . 

Atlanta Braves first baseman Fred McGriff owns the second-longest streak at 000 games .

OSCE delays decision on refugee voting . 

Kurt Schork 

SARAJEVO 0000-00-00 

Bosnia 's election organisers will decide on Tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting , an OSCE spokeswoman said on Monday . 

Officials from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of Serb refugees . 

International observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies . 

" Tomorrow ... 

the Provisional Election Commission will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only ... 

the other elections will be held on September 00 , " OSCE spokeswoman Agota Kuperman told reporters in Sarajevo . 

" I think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled . 

I think probably if the decision ( to <OOV> ) were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections .. 

. " 

Kuperman added that options other than postponement were also on the table , but she refused to specify what they were . 

The Dayton peace agreement gave the OSCE a mandate to organise Bosnian elections . 

The Provisional Election Commission is OSCE 's top rule-making body for the poll . 

More than 000,000 refugees have registered to vote in 00 countries around the world , representing about 00 per cent of Bosnia 's total electorate . 

They are due to begin voting on Wednesday , August 00 , just one day after the PEC is supposed to make its decision . 

Balloting inside Bosnia is scheduled for September 00 , when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies , separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments , a national House of Representatives and a three-man Presidency . 

A Sarajevo daily newspaper , Dnevi Avaz , which is close to Bosnia 's Moslem nationalist SDA party , on Monday said the OSCE would postpone the <OOV> elections until the Spring of 0000 because of the refugee registration problems . 

SDA has a representative on the Provisional Election Commission . 

" I do n't know what the source of the Dnevi Avaz report is , but it is consistent with what I have heard from western diplomats and from inside the OSCE , " said an OSCE staff member in Sarajevo who asked not to be named . 

" The word is that Frowick has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the PEC on Tuesday to take everyone 's temperature on the issue . " 

Ambassador Robert Frowick , an American , heads the OSCE mission in Bosnia . 

OSCE and independent monitors allege that Serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war . 

Instead , the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had Moslem majorities before the 00-month Bosnian war , but which are now underpopulated as a result of " ethnic cleansing " . 

Diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure Serb control over pivotal towns inside the 00 per cent of Bosnia known as the Serb republic , consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war . 

The top U.N. refugee official in the Balkans highlighted the voter registration problem on Monday . 

" Results of the registration for September elections herald a dismal future for multi-ethnicity in <OOV> , " warned Soren Jessen-Petersen , Special Envoy for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Former Yugoslavia . 

" In the run-up to elections , nationalistic political leaders are playing the ethnic / sectarian card , drumming up support within their constituencies by playing on bitter memories or fear . " 

After truce , Lebed faces tougher Chechen problem . 

Alastair Macdonald 

MOSCOW 0000-00-00 

Alexander Lebed may finally get to discuss his Chechen peace proposals with Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels . 

It could be a sobering experience for the Kremlin security chief who , just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the Chechen crisis , had promised to wrap up the 00-month war by the weekend . 

Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war , Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a long-term settlement , somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of Russia , will be no easy matter . 

A chain-smoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan <OOV> and a soldier 's knack for making life sound simple , Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week , days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebel-held Chechen capital Grozny . 

He returned at the weekend , pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed . 

But then he apparently thought better of it . 

Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal -- and also cover his back against unnamed pro-war schemers in Moscow -- he flew back to the capital empty-handed on Sunday . 

He met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday and , according to the press service of Lebed 's Security Council , could meet Yeltsin on Tuesday . 

It was not clear if the start of Yeltsin 's holiday , announced later , would affect plans to talk . 

Moscow 's as yet undisclosed proposals on Chechnya 's political future have , meanwhile , been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments . 

It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan . 

Speculation mounted last week that Lebed was operating out on a limb in Chechnya as Yeltsin , hardly seen since his reelection last month , kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce . 

But Chernomyrdin took pains at the weekend to insist Lebed was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov had been agreed by Yeltsin . 

If that were the case , it was unclear why Lebed suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in Moscow . 

Lebed himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in Moscow , who have profited from the war and want it to go on , would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him . 

Maskhadov warned that Lebed risked the same fate as a former Russian army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by -- so the Chechens say -- Russian forces . 

Maskhadov may also have made new demands on Lebed , forcing him to check back with the Kremlin on what he could offer . 

A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a face-saving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date . 

Chernomyrdin said voters should decide Chechnya 's future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the Russian Federation -- something Moscow fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions , particularly in the strategic North Caucasus . 

Lebed may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war . 

Yeltsin on holiday from Monday - Interfax . 

MOSCOW 0000-00-00 

Russian President Boris Yeltsin began a new summer holiday on Monday but would remain in control of affairs of state , Interfax news agency said . 

" The head of state 's holiday has only just begun , " the agency quoted Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying , adding that the president was currently in a Kremlin residence near Moscow . 

Interfax said <OOV> did not exclude that Yeltsin could spend some time in other places . 

He would continue working on various documents and might meet " one state offical or another " . 

" One must give B. Yeltsin a chance to rest and recover his health after the elections , " Interfax quoted <OOV> as saying . 

" ( Yeltsin ) controls internal and international policies , daily receives a big packet of documents from Moscow , which demand his intervention ... 

Many of those documents return to the president 's administration the same day , " he said . 

Yeltsin went on a two-day trip outside Moscow last week to check out a holiday home . 

Yugo Zastava workers ' protest enters 0nd week . 

BELGRADE 0000-00-00 

Thousands of workers of Serbia 's Zastava arms factory entered the second week of protests on Monday over unpaid wages and the lack of a programme to revive the plant 's production . 

" We are stubborn , have strength and time to persist until our demands are met , " said the factory 's trade union secretary Dragutin <OOV> . 

" We are united and we are waiting for the government to decide what to do with us . " 

Trade unions demanded payment of June and July wages and last year 's holiday pay , and called on government to develop a revival programme for the plant . 

The former Yugoslav national army consumed 00 percent of Zastava 's pre-war output , but like the rest of Yugoslavia 's economy , the new army of Serbia and Montenegro is crippled by lack of funds . 

In Kragujevac where the plant is based , 0,000 to 00,000 people gathered in the central square to express their bitterness at what <OOV> called government indifference . 

The ruling Socialist Party last week accused Serbia 's opposition of stirring up social unrest and using workers ' already difficult social position for their own interests . 

" Late wages , no work and ( the lack of a ) production programme are the main reasons for their protests , " a senior member of the local Socialist Party branch told Reuters . 

" But there is a significant influence of opposition parties that are collecting points ahead of coming elections . " 

Federal Yugoslav elections are due on November 0 . 

The party official said the union 's figure on the number of protesters was exaggerated . " 

There were about 0,000 to 0,000 people at the protest today -- much less then last week . 

" But there were more observers and passers by , " he said .

<OOV> Bulgaria air traffic controllers to strike September 0 . 

SOFIA 0000-00-00 

Bulgarian air traffic controllers will go on strike on September 0 demanding higher pay , the chief of the Bulgarian association of air traffic controllers ( <OOV> ) said on Monday . 

Stefan Raichev told a news conference the strike by more than half of the 0,000 traffic controllers and technicians would paralyse traffic which has increased by 00 percent since last year . 

More than 0,000 planes per day fly over Bulgaria , in a strategic location between Europe and the Middle and the Far East , Raichev said . 

The director general of the air traffic service Valentin <OOV> said last Friday that a controllers ' strike would be illegal . 

<OOV> said he could not curb the summer charter flights of national carrier Balkan Airlines , which carries thousands of foreign tourists to the Bulgarian Black Sea resorts . 

But Raichev said it would be " discrimination " against the other airlines if only Balkan planes were guided in . 

" Under the law before launching the strike we have to sign an agreement with our employer for a minimal transport servicing of emergency flights , " Raichev said . 

Raichev said a lock-out with military air controllers was impossible as they did not speak English . 

The controllers are demanding the monthly wage be increased to $ 0,000 per month from the current $ 000 , as well as the resignation of the air traffic service 's management . 

They also demand the financial separation of the 000 air controllers from the technical staff .

Unconfirmed news reports said a vehicle belonging to them was found abandoned at Santa Maria de <OOV> , about 00 miles ( 00 km ) north of the site of the abduction . 

The reports said authorities found a statement , supposedly from the kidnappers , in the vehicle , addressed to <OOV> and demanding a $ 0.0 million ransom .

Colombian peso closes lower , importers buy dlrs . 

BOGOTA 0000-00-00 

Colombia 's peso closed lower at 0,000 after coming under pressure from dollar-buying by importers seeking to meet their commitments abroad , interbank dealers said . 

It was the second consecutive session that saw the peso , which ended at 0,000 Friday , close lower . 

" The ( dollar 's ) rise was due to demand from importers who have a lot of wire transfers accumulated , " one dealer said . 

Contributing to the peso 's weakness , another dealer said banks who might have sold greenbacks in Monday 's trading appeared to shy away from the market . 

This , according to the trader , was typical of month-end position-squaring -- and the fact that a stronger U.S. currency helps limit some foreign exchange losses . 

Dealers reported 000 trades for a total of $ 000 million and said the peso hit an intra-day high of 0,000 before heading lower into the close .

Indonesian rupiah stable in quiet late trading . 

JAKARTA 0000-00-00 

The Indonesian rupiah was stable against the dollar in quiet trading on Monday , dealers said . 

They said volume was thin following a public holiday in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom . 

" We did n't see anything from Singapore operators either . 

It 's a pretty quiet day , " one foreign bank dealer said . 

Spot rupiah was quoted at 0,000.0 / 00.0 at 0000 GMT , unchanged from the opening level . 

It was softer in the morning due to relatively ample rupiah liquidity but recovered later . 

Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 0,000.00 / 00.00 and 0,000.0 / 00.0 , respectively . 

Another dealer said operators were reluctant to unload rupiah despite ample conditions due to the month-end factor . 

" There are two factors which determine the market at present . 

The liquidity at month-end and the next court hearing scheduled for Thursday , " the dealer said . 

Megawati Sukarnoputri , deposed leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party ( PDI ) has sued the government for ousting her as PDI leader . 

The central Jakarta court adjourned the case last Thursday for possible out-of-court settlement . 

The hearing is due to resume on Thursday . 

Megawati 's lawyers said they were still discussing a possible out of court settlement but they was not optimistic an agreement could be reached .

Israeli security forces ransacked a Bedouin encampment in the West Bank on Monday to expel them from an area which Palestinians say had been earmarked for Jewish settlement expansion , residents said . 

They said soldiers stole a gold necklace and about $ 0,000 in Israeli currency from an elderly woman and her daughter-in-law while rummaging through their luggage before destroying family shacks and animal barns .

However , USDA reported tops of $ 00.00 in Illinois and in Iowa / southern Minnesota , $ 00.00 on some hogs Monday .

Gore presents new image of lead attack dog . 

Michael <OOV> 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

No more mild-mannered and meek Al Gore , the vice president and likely heir apparent to President Bill Clinton , emerged on Monday as the new Democratic attack dog leading a front-line assault on Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich . 

While Clinton takes a train trip to the Democratic Convention that will renominate him on Wednesday for a second term , Gore is the bright star in the convention city now . 

Crowds anxiously wait for his appearances , thrusting out hands for him to grip as they scream " 00 more years " -- a wishful hope to eight years of Gore after a Clinton re-election . 

Over a <OOV> span from Sunday evening to Monday morning , so many people jammed Gore events that the fire marshal stopped members of Congress , reporters and others from entering a pro-Israel rally and a meeting of the New York delegation . 

In his appearances , the often stiff and wooden Gore seemed transformed into a new energetic , gesturing " pol " as he ripped into Republican presidential nominee Dole and Gingrich , who has emerged as the favorite right-wing foil of Democrats . 

Gore told a roaring labor rally of about 0,000 union workers that Dole and Gingrich were the virtual <OOV> of evil , without even mentioning that former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is Dole 's running mate . 

" With equal measures of ignorance and audacity this two-headed monster of Dole and Gingrich has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress of behalf of working men and women , " Gore said to whoops of " 00 more years . " 

" They want to drive you out of politics and they ca n't , " he added . " 

They want to silence your voices in elections . " 

At a downtown hotel Monday , the 00-year-old Gore gave Wisconsin delegates a taste again of the new Gore . 

" I want you to ask this question . 

What would Wisconsin face if the same extremist coalition , the Gingrich / Dole Congress , also controlled the executive branch ? " 

Gore said . 

Noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three Supreme Court justice nominations , he warned , " Their extremist agenda would come out of the Gingrich Congress , into and through the Dole White House , down through the Supreme Court . " 

He painted a scene of horrors he saw if Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress they hold now . " 

Our personal and religious liberties would be at risk . 

Medicare would be at risk of withering on the vine . 

Medicaid would be at risk of being taken away from poor children . 

Education would be at risk . 

The environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition , " he said . 

His new style mixed an assault on Republicans with what he sees as " productive opportunity , a vision for the future that lifts up working families , that builds Wisconsin stronger , that builds America stronger . 

With your help we can re-elect Bill Clinton . " 

Dole 's tax cut plans were called " <OOV> economics .... It 's a warmed-over plan that failed and drove our economy into a ditch . 

We got burned once and we wo n't let that happen to our nation again . " 

Gore ridiculed Dole 's defense of the tobacco industry , praised Clinton for " courage " in advancing regulations of it . 

To the delegates of Wisconsin , a leading dairy state , Gore had the right audience in poking fun at Dole 's comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who ca n't tolerate milk . 

" Some people say milk is bad for you , " Gore said as Wisconsin delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow . 

He praised Clinton for vetoing the Republican Congress ' attempt to repeal parts of the Clean Air Act , and criticized Republicans for " slashing money to combat drugs in schools . " 

" The choice has never been starker , the stakes today have never been higher , " Gore said . " 

We 're not going to let them get away with that . " 

Actor Reeve highlights Democrats ' first night . 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity . 

Among the latter were gun control advocate Sarah Brady and actor Christopher Reeve and the politicians included Rep . 

Richard Gephardt and Sen . 

Thomas Daschle . 

Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention 's key Monday speakers . 

Sarah Brady -- The nation 's toughest gun control law is named after Ronald Reagan 's press secretary James Brady but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage . 

As head of Handgun Control Inc. , Sarah Brady , 00 , campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President Reagan in 0000 . 

Her reward was the passage in 0000 of the " Brady Bill " which requires a mandatory five-day waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for would-be gun purchasers . 

Reagan recovered fully from his wounds but Brady , who was close to death after being shot by John Hinckley Jr . 

, suffered serious brain damage . 

Sarah was Brady 's second wife and they have a son , James Scott Brady Jr . 

Before the assassination attempt , she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the Republican Party . 

Christopher Reeve -- Reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero Superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life . 

Reeve , an accomplished rider who owned several horses , suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in Culpepper , Virginia , on May 00 , 0000 . 

Almost entirely paralyzed , Reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine . 

That allowed him to be moved to a <OOV> position . 

Over time he regained the power of speech , so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention . 

Reeve , 00 , was classically trained as an actor but became the <OOV> handsome leading man . 

He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in " Superman " and three sequels . 

Richard Gephardt -- Gephardt , House Democratic leader , is a politician with a " Mr Clean " reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job . 

Gephardt , 00 , the son of a milkman from a working class district of St. Louis , is a consummate congressional insider , sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the <OOV> House Democrats . 

A former lawyer , he was in the front line of President Bill Clinton 's battle with the Republican-led Congress over the budget but has opposed the president 's decision to sign the <OOV> welfare reform bill . 

He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut U.S. trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party 's liberal wing . 

He was an opponent of abortion until 0000 and voted for President Ronald Reagan 's big tax cut bill . 

Gephardt , a red-haired square-jawed man , is a less than fiery orator . 

His 0000 bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a <OOV> reformer of the establishment , standing up for blue collar workers and farmers . 

Tom Daschle -- Daschle , 00 , was largely unknown outside Washington and his state of South Dakota when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become Senate Democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the Republicans in 0000 . 

A mild-mannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the Senate in 0000 , he presented himself as a Midwest moderate , as a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite Senate factions . 

Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader Bob Dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge , <OOV> Dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage . 

In his early Senate years he was seen as a " prairie populist " , working on legislation protecting farmers ' prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War . 

Daschle was a key player in President Bill Clinton 's failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no <OOV> for the White House . 

He has made clear he opposed Clinton 's signing of the <OOV> welfare reform bill . 

He has spent his adult life in politics , coming to Congress as an aide in 0000 after three years in the Air Force and then being elected to the House of Representatives himself in 0000 . 

U.S. boy , 00 , accused of murdering adoptive mother . 

DALLAS 0000-00-00 

A 00-year-old Dallas boy has been charged with murdering his adoptive mother over the weekend , police said on Monday . 

Margaret McCullough , 00 , was found dead in her home on Saturday with gunshot wounds to the head . 

Police , who at first thought her son had been kidnapped , found him on Sunday with a friend in his mother 's car in Oklahoma and arrested him . 

A shotgun and a .000 handgun were found in the car . 

A police spokesman said the boy was being questioned . " 

They are talking to him now about the motive and everything else . " 

McCullough had adopted the boy , who was the grandson of her late husband , shortly after his birth but neighbours said they often had loud arguments . 

Pakistani bourse to use new <OOV> index . 

KARACHI , Pakistan 0000-00-00

A KSE statement said the <OOV> index would be more representative , capturing market capitalisation of 00.0 percent , up from 00.0 percent previously .

<OOV> oil products mixed , holiday <OOV> trade . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

<OOV> oil products were mixed on Monday but markets were becalmed because of a public holiday in the United Kingdom , traders said . 

An explosion at Repsol 's <OOV> refinery , which killed four workers , had not affected output of oil products , an official said . 

" The plant is functioning as usual , " Jose Manuel Prieto , director of personnel , told Spanish state television . 

Gasoline prices were <OOV> unchanged from Friday despite sagging NYMEX numbers , with the arbitrage window to the U.S. considered closed for the moment . 

<OOV> barges were offered at $ 000 fob ARA for <OOV> barrels , and at $ 000 for full ARA material . 

" There is no market at the moment , " one Rotterdam trader said . " 

Maybe sentiment is a little bit weaker but prices have not changed . " 

Outright gas oil prices were <OOV> softer as the NYMEX heating oil contract headed lower , and following news that the Indian Oil Corp ( IOC ) had issued a tender to buy only 000,000 tonnes of high speed diesel for October . 

Asian traders had earlier expected an IOC tender for around 000,000 tonnes . 

ARA gas oil barges were quiet although one trader said he had seen offers at $ 0 a tonne over September IPE for prompt barrels , while Antwerp material was available for 0-00 cents over September . 

The IOC tender had " a bearish impact , but not a great impact , " one German player said . 

Fuel oil markets were also listless . 

Offers were around a dollar a tonne higher at $ 000 fob ARA but bids were scarce .

Chelsea makes political debut on Clinton train trip . 

<OOV> , Ohio 0000-00-00 

- Chelsea Clinton , until now carefully shielded from the exposure of public life , made her political debut on Sunday on her father 's whistlestop train trip . 

Chelsea , 00 , was at President Bill Clinton 's side as he rode the rails through parts of West Virginia , Kentucky and Ohio , and was introduced at every stop . 

She even worked <OOV> , shaking hands with excited fans . 

Hillary Rodham Clinton saw her husband and daughter off on the trip in Huntington , West Virginia and then went on to Chicago to begin a rigorous Democratic Convention schedule . 

Asked if Chelsea would have a prominent role in the campaign , White House spokesman Mike McCurry said : " She 'll do what she did today when she can . 

She has to go back to school . " 

The president 's daughter is going into her senior year of high school at Sidwell Friends School , a private school in Washington . 

McCurry said Chelsea has asked to go on the train trip and attend the convention where her father will be renominated , but said her exposure did not signal the start of a new political career . 

Chelsea " is a very poised young lady , but she 's not that much interested in politics , " the spokesman said . 

Dutch closing share market report . 

AMSTERDAM 0000-00-00 

Dutch shares drifted to a lower close on Monday , dragged down by weakness in the domestic bond market and turnover depressed by the UK bank holiday and lack of any significant U.S. economic data . 

The AEX index of leading shares closed 0.00 points easier at 000.00 , the day 's low . 

The Dutch market had been on the defensive all day but a softer start to Wall Street did little to boost sentiment in late trade , dealers said . 

" It was always going to be a tough day with participation so low . 

But the only thing really worrying the market was the bonds , and that dragged us lower , " one dealer said . 

Stocks were down across the board , with Dutch PTT topping the volume list and closing down 0.00 guilders at 00.00 . 

The post and telecoms firm posted an 0.0 percent rise in first half earnings on Friday , just below analysts ' expectations . 

IHC <OOV> reported first half results well under forecasts on Monday and the shares suffered as a result . 

They were trading unchanged just before the release of figures but closed 0.00 guilders down at 00.00 after it reported net profits of 00.0 million guilders against 00.0 million last year and estimates ranging from 00.0 to 00.0 million . 

IHC also forecast post tax earnings rising 00 percent for the full year . 

Banking group ING traded ex-dividend today and finished 0.00 guilders weaker at 00.00 as a result . 

But <OOV> shrugged off its <OOV> tag to soar a further 0.00 guilders to 000.00 continuing its explosive rally sparked by the 00 percent jump in first half net profits last week , which set the market alight on Friday , sending the shares up 00.00 at 000.00 by the close . 

Engineering concern Stork started the day well as the shares attracted some follow-through interest to the announcement late on Friday that its Fokker Aviation unit had won a major order . 

But the rally was short-lived and Stork ended just 0.00 up at 00.00 guilders .

Tapie to quit French assembly seat as film opens . 

PARIS 0000-00-00 

Former businessman and soccer boss Bernard Tapie said that he would give up his seat in the National Assembly by Wednesday , the day a film by Claude <OOV> in which he stars opens in France . 

" I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens , " he said in a broadcast interview . 

" Just about , " he told Europe 0 radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin . 

A Seguin spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received . 

Tapie , 00 , was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the Assembly following a finding by the Supreme Court that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a five-year period . 

Tapie , the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his <OOV> business empire and the Marseille soccer team he once ran , has a starring role in <OOV> 's " Homme , femmes : mode d'emploi " ( Men , women : instructions for use ) . 

He plays a power-hungry lawyer in the movie described as " a tender and cruel comedy " by <OOV> , who is making his 00th film . 

" I have paid too dearly for mixing two careers , " Tapie said . " 

In France , you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time . 

That is why I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens . " 

Justice Minister Jacques Toubon began last month the formal process of ejecting Tapie from the French parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the European parliament . 

The French procedure was expected to be completed before October 0 , when the National Assembly is to reconvene after a summer break , but the European procedure was expected to take longer . 

Tapie 's lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his European seat . 

But such an appeal , even if the court were to accept the case , which it is not obliged to do , would not suspend enforcement of the French judgement against him . 

Tapie faces a probable spell in prison after he loses his parliamentary immunity , since two appeal courts have confirmed jail sentences of eight and six months against him for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match . 

He is appealing in both cases to the Supreme Court . 

Bank of France drains 0.0 bln <OOV> at tender .

It allotted a further 00.0 billion to bidders putting up private paper , satisfying 00.0 percent of this demand .

Dutch co-operative bank Rabobank Nederland BA 's net profit growth might slow to less than than 00 year percent in the second half of 0000 , executive board chairman Herman <OOV> said on Monday . 

The unlisted bank earlier announced a 0000 interim net profit of 000 million guilders , up 00.0 percent on the 000 million guilders reported in the first half of 0000 . 

He said second-half profit growth would depend on customer demand for loans , which was already easing , and the performance of financial markets , which were strong in the first half and boosted securities , trading and underwriting income . 

" We expect reasonable growth in the second half . 

Maybe it will be in single-digits , " <OOV> told Reuters . 

He said growth in customer demand in the first half was 00 percent above normal but it was hard to maintain this pace . 

Rabobank 's net profit was 0.00 billion guilders in 0000 . 

The bank earlier warned that profit growth would slow in the second half , citing the increasing momentum in profit growth in the comparative period of 0000 and increased investment . 

But <OOV> was unable to quantify second half investment to improve and extend domestic and offshore services .

Thai PM proposes Sept 00 for no-confidence debate . 

BANGKOK 0000-00-00 

Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa on Monday proposed September 00 as the date for parliamentary debate on an opposition no-confidence motion accusing him of incompetence . 

The president of parliament had earlier said September 00 could be set for the debate . 

The opposition motion against Banharn accuses him of being incompetent , lacking ethical leadership and alleges his administration is corrupt . 

His critics allege he may be attempting to delay the debate . 

Banharn has denied the accusations and said he is ready to clear himself in parliament . 

" In my opinion September 00 would be a convenient date for the government to answer questions . 

This has nothing to do with the accusation that I am trying to escape the debate , " Banharn told reporters after meeting coalition partners . 

Banharn 's 00-month-old , six-party coalition government controls 000 seats in the <OOV> lower house of parliament . 

Political infighting within Banharn 's Chart Thai party has raised doubts whether he can hold his supporters together and defeat the opposition motion , political analysts said .

September 00 is regarded as tentative because we still have not received the order to fix it on the agenda , " said an official at parliament 's agenda section . 

The last no-confidence debate against Banharn 's coalition in May was won by the government .

FOCUS - <OOV> end mixed but London recovers . 

Leonard <OOV> 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with London clawing back most of the day 's losses despite an unsteady start on wall Street , hit by inflation worries . 

The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over Tokyo 's monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese Tankan economic survey out on Wednesday . 

But it recovered at the close of trade . 

Stocks in London started the week badly after a three-day weekend , slipping 0.0 percent , but bargain-hunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground . 

Tuesday 's patchy showing in London followed a string of records last week , culminating in Friday 's trading high of 0,000 , fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts . 

The London bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on Wall Street , which slipped in and out of positive ground after a stronger-than-expected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears , pulling U.S. Treasuries back from their early peaks . 

Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to 000.0 in August from a revised 000.0 in July , Wall Street relinquished virtually all its morning gains . 

" Treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we 're still in that summer <OOV> period of light trading , " said Alan Ackerman , market strategist at Fahnestock & Co . " 

Consequently , stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings . " 

Frankfurt was the one bright spot in Europe . 

Floor trading ended up 0.00 percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly 0.0 percent , given a push by the performance of chemical shares . " 

The market is trading 000 percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears -- it 's all company news , " said one trader . 

French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc , dealers said . 

Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at 0.0000 per mark for the first time since August 00 as worries about the government 's autumn budget and a weak U.S. currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments . 

The dollar , which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese Tankan survey , weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday 's levels . 

" Besides the Tankan , there 's nothing really until the U.S. jobs numbers next week , " said a UK bank corporate dealer . " 

There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market . " 

Foreign exchange markets regard the Tankan report as an important indication of the country 's future monetary policy direction . 

If it points to weakness in the economy , the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a near-term rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate . 

The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.0 percent . 

The dollar was also pressured by the mark 's strength against European currencies amid renewed concerns over Europe 's economic and monetary union ( EMU ) timetable . 

CURRENCIES 

The dollar was at 0.0000 marks and 000.00 yen at the close of European trading compared with 0.0000 marks and 000.00 yen on Monday .

More hostages freed from hijacked Sudanese plane . 

STANSTED , England 0000-00-00 

Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released between 00 and 00 people on Tuesday from a Sudan Airways plane carrying 000 passengers and crew that landed in London after being diverted on a flight from Khartoum to Amman , authorities said . 

A spokesman for Stansted airport said that the unidentified hijackers were demanding to see a British-based member of the Iraqi Community Association , called Mr <OOV> , and that police were trying to trace him . 

Police spokeswoman Kim White said police had already contacted <OOV> and were trying to arrange to bring him to Stansted , 00 miles ( 00 km ) north-east of London , to talk to the hijackers . 

The airport spokesman said the six hijackers , who police said were armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , were believed to be Iraqi nationals . 

The hijackers started to release people for the Airbus plane in batches of 00 , starting with women and children , in what police described as a " controlled release " . 

Police said most of the passengers were Sudanese but that there were also an unknown number of Iraqis , Jordanians , Palestinians , Syrians and Saudis . 

Later they said the number of passengers released from the plane had reached 00 . 

FEATURE - " Eco terrorists " target UK builders . 

Edna Fernandes 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry , striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins . 

Described by one British company as " <OOV> " , it is seen as the new business risk of the 0000s . 

Famous names like Tarmac Plc , Costain Group Plc and ARC , a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc , have all been targeted . 

Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless , badly organised <OOV> of students and hippies . 

" You only have to see them in action at protests , " said David Harding , spokesman at ARC , Hanson 's aggregates company . " 

They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment , they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we 're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation . " 

One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal " Building " earlier this year , " If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare , we will aim to drive them out of business . " 

As well as financial threats , companies also emphasise the " terror " tactics used . 

Costain 's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass , which runs through a conservation area , has led to violent protests delaying building , bomb threats , staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell 's home . 

A Costain spokesman told Reuters : " We 've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive 's house . 

But it 's when it gets to the ( employee ) families -- that it goes across the line . " 

Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood <OOV> , which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives , are now the subject of a police investigation . 

Other larger activist groups include Earth First , The Land is Ours , Alarm UK and Road Alert . 

The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M0 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire . 

But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic , pollution and damage local communities . 

The government has slashed its road-building spending . 

Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological . 

Graham Watts , chief executive of the Construction Industry Council , said : " I do n't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project . 

" But they are more alert than they were 0-0 years ago . 

There 's no doubt it 's a big issue now . " 

He says the damage comes in two forms : " <OOV> -- in the form of extra costs , additional security , threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity . " 

Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract . 

" I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss . " 

ARC says it 's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself . 

Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass . 

" It was called the " First Battle of the Newbury bypass ' , " said ARC 's Harding . 

" We had 000 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site . 

Hundreds of thousands of pounds ( dollars ) of damage was done in one day . 

Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future . " 

Simon Brown , analyst at investement bank UBS , said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk . 

" When talking to Tarmac about the M0 link ( through Twyford Down ) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis . " 

Harding says others have done the same . " 

As a result of <OOV> we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security . " 

For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins , overcapacity and stagnant demand , <OOV> is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector 's tale of woe . 

London Carnival ends in high spirits . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

London 's annual Notting Hill Carnival , the largest in Europe and second in the world only to Rio , ended peacefully on Monday with an estimated 000,000 revellers singing and dancing the day away in high spirits . 

Police said they made 00 arrests and there were two stabbings . 

But there was no repeat of the ugly scenes that used to scar the street festival , and police praised the crowds over the two days of festivities as good-natured . 

Around 000 police were wounded in riots in 0000 when the carnival , now in its 00st year , acquired its darker reputation from which it is now only slowly recovering . 

Shopkeepers still board up their windows and many residents leave town for the weekend , but for four or five years there has been no disorder and relatively little crime .

Indonesia newspaper reports central bank scandal . 

JAKARTA 0000-00-00 

Indonesia 's central bank suffered seven billion rupiah ( $ 0.0 million ) in losses resulting from fake transactions , the Jakarta Post reported on Tuesday . 

A Bank Indonesia spokeswoman confirmed the newspaper report but declined to give further details . 

The bank 's governor Sudradjat Djiwandono was quoted as saying on Monday about 0.0 billion rupiah of the seven billion rupiah had been recovered . 

The newspaper said it was the central bank 's first public scandal in its 00-year history . 

The paper said five people had been arrested and police were looking for two more suspects .

GOLF - PLAYERS <OOV> ON CART <OOV> FOR <OOV> . 

NORTHAMPTON , England 0000-00-00 

Seve Ballesteros and Colin Montgomerie are divided on whether Jose Maria Olazabal should be allowed to return to the European PGA Tour using a motorised cart to transport him around the course . 

The Spaniard has not played for nearly a year because of rheumatoid arthritis in both his feet , and organisers of a pairs event to be staged in Bordeaux , France from October 00 to 00 have been asked to provide him with a buggy . 

" If the ( Tour 's tournament ) committee decides to change the rule I would not be against it , " said Ballesteros , Olazabal 's compatriot and Ryder Cup captain . 

But commitee member Montgomerie said it could set an unhelpful precedent . " 

I know Olly 's situation is very unfortunate , but I do n't think we can start giving dispensations , " he said . " 

You 've got to have a rule for everybody and I do n't think it 's feasible . " 

The use of carts is generally prohibited in the professional game , and if Olazabal is allowed to use one in Bordeaux , he might then request one for the qualifying tournaments for next year 's Ryder Cup .

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Stefan Edberg produced some of his vintage best on Tuesday to extend his grand run at the Grand Slams by toppling Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek in straight sets at the U.S. Open . 

Edberg , competing in the 00th consecutive and final Grand Slam event of his illustrious career , turned back the clock at Stadium Court with a flowing 0-0 0-0 0-0 serve-and-volley victory over the fifth-seeded Dutchman . 

" It 's a win that I can be proud of , " said the 00-year-old Swede , winner of two U.S. Opens and six Grand Slam titles in all . " 

It 's never easy to beat the Wimbledon champion . " 

Edberg , who has said he will retire at season 's end , made it look easy under gray skies at the National Tennis Centre . 

The unseeded Swede struck quickly , breaking Krajicek in the first game and never let loose his grip on the one hour 00 minute match as he served and volleyed with the grace that made him one of the dominant players of his time . 

" There 's not doubt about it , Richard was definitely off his game and I took advantage , " said Edberg . 

" I still have my days where I feel great out there . " 

Also reaching the second round were top-seeded defending champion Pete Sampras , a 0-0 0-0 0-0 winner over last minute replacement Jimy Szymanski of Venezuela , called on after Adrian Voinea of Romania withdrew because of a sprained ankle . 

Third seed Thomas Muster of Austria also charged into the second round with a 0-0 0-0 ( 0-0 ) 0-0 romp over Javier Frana of Argentina . 

Marcelo Rios of Chile , the 00th seed , also advanced . 

Rios claimed a 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 victory over Romania 's Andrei Pavel . 

On the women 's side , second seed Monica Seles got off to a strong start by beating fellow-American Anne Miller 0-0 0-0 and was joined in the second round by Spain 's Arantxa Sanchez Vicario ( seeded third ) , Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport ( 0 ) and Karina Habsudova of Slovakia ( 00 ) . 

The women 's draw lost another seed when Austrian Judith Wiesner overcame Iva Majoli of Croatia 0-0 0-0 0-0 . 

The <OOV> seeded Majoli joined Anke Huber ( 0 ) and Magdalena Maleeva ( 00 ) on the sidelines .

SAN FRANCISCO 0000-00-00 

William <OOV> pitched eight scoreless innings and <OOV> Hill drove in the game 's only run with a first-inning single as the San Francisco Giants claimed a 0-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday . 

<OOV> ( 0-00 ) , who entered the game with one complete game in the first 00 starts of his career , limited the Phillies to two hits and two walks with four strikeouts . 

" We 've been working all year on my follow-through , and I really concentrated on that , " <OOV> said . " 

It gave me more life in all of my pitches , so the ball moved more . " 

At Colorado , Andres Galarraga homered and drove in three runs as the Colorado Rockies had 00 extra-base hits and Billy Swift won his first game in almost a year in a 0-0 rain-shortened <OOV> victory over the Cincinnati Reds .

BALTIMORE 0000-00-00 

Cal Ripken 's bases-loaded walk scored Brady Anderson with the winning run in the bottom of the 00th as the Baltimore Orioles regained control of the top spot in the wild-card race with a wild 00-00 victory over the Oakland Athletics . 

Trailing by a run entering the 00th , the Orioles rallied against Oakland reliever Mark Acre ( 0-0 ) with a walk and a triple by Brady Anderson to tie the game . 

Then Oakland manager Art Howe decided to intentionally walk Rafael Palmeiro and Bobby Bonilla to load the bases but Acre was nowhere near the plate to Ripken . 

The decisive pitch nearly hit Ripken and gave the Orioles a one-half game lead over the Chicago White Sox in the wild-card race . 

In Seattle , Jay Buhner 's eighth-inning single snapped a tie as the Seattle Mariners edged the New York Yankees 0-0 in the opener of a three-game series . 

New York starter Jimmy Key left the game in the first inning after Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez lined a shot off his left elbow . 

The Yankees have lost 00 of their last 00 games and their lead in the AL East over Baltimore fell to five games . 

At California , Tim Wakefield pitched a six-hitter for his third complete game of the season and Mo Vaughn and Troy O'Leary hit solo home runs in the second inning as the surging Boston Red Sox won their third straight 0-0 over the California Angels . 

Boston has won seven of eight and is 00-0 since August 0nd .

In Toronto , Juan Guzman allowed three runs over seven innings to make homers by Joe Carter and Carlos Delgado stand up as the surging Toronto Blue Jays held off the Minnesota Twins , 0-0 . 

Toronto returned home from a <OOV> road trip and won for the eighth time in nine games as Guzman ( 00-0 ) allowed nine hits and struck out eight without a walk .

Larry Fine 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Michael Chang is playing in his 00th U.S. Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever , but the 00-year-old American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his first-round match on opening day . 

Chang , seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras , took two hours 00 minutes to defeat <OOV> Jaime Oncins of Brazil 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 , 0-0 in the tiebreaker . 

" I was pretty tight the whole match , " conceded Chang , one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a 00-0 record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runner-up finish . 

" Everyone has moments when they get tight . 

Hopefully , this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament . " 

Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runner-up MaliVai Washington , the 00th seed , who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami 0-0 0-0 0-0 ( 0-0 ) 0-0 . 

Washington 's win was not comfortable , either . 

The 00-year-old American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami . 

" Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like week-old sushi , " said Washington . " 

Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate . " 

Chang and Washington were the only men 's seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women 's players fall . 

Australian Open runner-up Anke Huber of Germany , the sixth seed , was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 00th ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match . 

Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a 0-0 0-0 0-0 victory . 

Last year 's Wimbledon junior champion , Aleksandra Olsza of Poland , removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number 00 Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria 0-0 0-0 . 

Other men 's winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round . 

Germany 's Michael Stich , the 0000 Wimbledon champion , and two-time French Open winner Sergi Bruguera of Spain will face each other next after beating German Tommy Haas 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 , and Belgian Kris Goossens 0-0 0-0 0-0 ( 0-0 ) , respectively . 

Alex O'Brien , who scored his first professional title eight days ago in New Haven , advanced to the second round with a 0-0 0-0 0-0 0-0 win over Ecuador 's Nicolas Lapentti . 

Wimbledon bad boy Jeff Tarango caught a break Monday when he advanced after the retirement of German Alex Radulescu due to heat exhaustion . 

Tarango was leading 0-0 ( 0-0 ) 0-0 0-0 0-0 . 

Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins , who had beaten him in the round of 00 at the 0000 Barcelona Olympics . 

Chang committed an untidy 00 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian , who also walloped a woeful 00 double faults . 

The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set , leading 0-0 in the tiebreaker . 

The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net . 

First Chang approached the umpire , then Oncins , then Chang again before play finally resumed . 

" Those little seconds were like an hour to me , " said Oncins , who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance . 

Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins , the contest was a personal victory . 

The 00-year-old Brazilian had risen into the top 00 in 0000 . 

The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo . 

He died slumped against Oncins , who subsequently lost interest in tennis . 

" Two months ago I started talking about quitting , " said Oncins , who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend . 

" I believe in my game again , " he said . 

At the end of the day , a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced . 

Eighth seed Jim Courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee , and 0000 Open champion Mats Wilander bowed out due to a groin pull , organisers said . 

Women 's ninth seed Mary Joe Fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist .

SOCCER - MARSEILLE HOLD AUXERRE TO <OOV> DRAW . 

PARIS 0000-00-00 

Former European champions Marseille held French champions Auxerre to a goalless draw in a lacklustre league match on Tuesday . 

The bill looked promising but both sides , struggling to find their form early in the season , were disappointing . 

Auxerre , who start their European Cup campaign next week against Ajax Amsterdam , dominated the match but were unable to score . 

Unbeaten in four matches , they still trail leaders Lens by one point . 

Lens , who have won all their three league matches so far , host Montpellier on Wednesday night . 

Despite another dismal performance , especially in defence , Marseille restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing 0-0 at home to Metz last Saturday . 

After two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season , some of whom do not speak a word of French , Marseille are not playing with any fluidity . 

But German international goalkeeper Andreas Koepke again proved a sound investment when under pressure from the Auxerre strikers , saving his team with a number of fine parries . 

Marseille now lie seventh in the league on five points .

SOCCER - NEUCHATEL TO APPEAL <OOV> <OOV> 'S <OOV> BAN . 

GENEVA 0000-00-00 

Swiss league leaders Neuchatel Xamax said on Tuesday they would appeal against a nine-month ban imposed on French international defender Jean-Pierre Cyprien for his part in a post-match brawl . 

Cyprien , also fined 00,000 Swiss francs ( $ 0,000 ) , traded punches with St Gallen 's Brazilian player Claudio Moura after a match on Saturday . 

When officials and coaching staff tried to intervene , Cyprien launched a flying kick at Moura , but only succeeded in kneeing St Gallen coach Roger <OOV> in the stomach . 

Moura , who appeared to have elbowed Cyprien in the final minutes of the 0-0 win by Neuchatel , was suspended for seven matches and fined 0,000 francs ( $ 000 ) by the Swiss league disciplinary committee . 

Club president Gilbert <OOV> said he was astonished the committee had arrived at its decision so quickly and vowed the club would appeal . 

Neuchatel coach Gilbert Gress described the incident as " shocking " , but said Moura was also to blame . 

" Moura physically and verbally provoked Cyprien during the match . 

The referee could not have seen it or he would have punished him , " Gress said . 

" During the scuffle , Moura threw the first punch . 

Tomorrow , if someone punches me , I would not know how to react . " 

Cyprien , who won his one French cap against Italy in February 0000 , cannot play in Switzerland or elsewhere until May next year . 

CYCLING - <OOV> <OOV> OF DOPING . 

MILAN 0000-00-00 

Veteran Italian Gianni Bugno has been cleared of doping after testing positive for high levels of testosterone during the Tour of Switzerland in June , the Italian cycling federation said on Tuesday . 

" He has been cleared . 

The case is closed , " a spokesman said . 

Bugno tested positive for the banned hormone after the fifth stage of the Tour , in which he finished third overall . 

But the spokesman said subsequent tests in Cologne proved his body produced higher-than-average testosterone levels naturally . 

Bugno , who won the Giro d'Italia in 0000 and two successive world titles , was banned for three months in 0000 after testing positive for the stimulant caffeine .

<OOV> <OOV> ON BUDAPEST BOURSE <OOV> <OOV> STRONG . 

<OOV> <OOV> 

BUDAPEST 0000-00-00 

Expectations that Cofinec S.A. , the Hungarian bourse 's first foreign listing , will report a disappointing first half have depressed the stock below its issue price , but analysts expect a rebound in the long term . 

" The first half of the year is unlikely to be as strong as expected so the company will probably be unable to reach its annual plan in 0000 , " said Gabor <OOV> , a London-based analyst for ING Barings . 

The French-registered packaging materials company , which floated its shares in Hungary in July , for most of the past two weeks hovered below the 0,000 forints / Global Depositary Receipts price of its initial offering , which was oversubscribed . 

The company , which asked for a two-week delay from the usual August 00 deadline for reporting first-half results , closed on Tuesday at 0,000 forints , down 000 . 

" Cofinec 's first-half figures will be ... 

between one-third of two-fifths of its annual plan , " said Tamas Erdei , a Budapest-based analyst for ABN-AMRO Hoare Govett . 

Analysts blame , at least partly , Hungary 's macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for Cofinec which , operating in Hungary , Poland and the Czech Republic , now generates about 00 to 00 percent of its annual sales from Hungary . 

Hungary 's Gross Domestic Product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged 0.0 percentage points in the first half of 0000 . 

Both will have their impact on Cofinec 's figures , the analysts said . 

Despite the current difficulties , however , analysts were convinced that Cofinec 's outlook was strong . 

" The eastern European market offers good chances , " said Erdei . " 

Just like many other companies on the bourse , Cofinec has big growth opportunities . " 

" At the same time , it 's an advantage for Cofinec that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better , " Erdei added . 

" Cofinec is a very good story in the long-term as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east Europe that a very strong increase can be expected ( long-term ) , " <OOV> said , saying that several recent moves by Cofinec boosted its position . 

Among them , he noted that Cofinec had acquired the outstanding stake in its Czech folding company <OOV> <OOV> , increasing its ownership to 000 percent , so in the second half the whole of <OOV> 's figures will be consolidated . 

The company also repaid some $ 00 million of debt , well above the originally planned $ 0 million to $ 0 million . 

In addition , its Polish operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned .

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

The Chicago Board Options Exchange ( <OOV> ) said on Tuesday it was doing a routine investigation into trading in options on MFS Communications Co Inc shares . 

On Monday , the company said it had agreed to be acquired by WorldCom Inc in a deal valued at $ 00 billion . 

MFS shares surged on the news while WorldCom fell on fears of dilution . 

The New York Times said on Tuesday some of the options trading in MFS last Friday may suggest insider trading . 

MFS options also trade on the American Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange . 

A spokesman for the American Stock Exchange would neither confirm or deny whether the exchange was looking into trading . 

" If there is unusual activity , certainly we look at it , but that 's not to say we 're doing anything official , " he said . 

Pacific Stock Exchange officials were not available . 

One trader said trading in MFS options had increased steadily from about mid-August , and doubted whether any of last Friday 's activity was insider trading .

Faulding Inc said on Tuesday Purdue Frederick Co filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Faulding and its <OOV> <OOV> unit . 

The suit was filed because of <OOV> 's manufacture of Kadian , a sustained release morphine product , Faulding said . 

Faulding said the claims in the lawsuit are without merit and will not impact upon the launch of Kadian in the United States . 

Kadian was approved for sale in the United States last month , Faulding said .

McGrath left out of Ireland World Cup squad . 

DUBLIN 0000-00-00 

Ireland 's most experienced player , defender Paul McGrath , was left out of the national squad for the first time in 00 years on Tuesday when new manager Mick McCarthy named his side to face Liechtenstein in a World Cup qualifier . 

The 00-year-old Aston Villa player won the last of his Irish record of 00 international caps against the Czech Republic in Prague in April . 

" Paul accepted the situation . 

He has n't played any first-team games for Villa this season and he 's not the type of player I would have brought on as a substitute , " McCarthy said . " 

But he surprised me in training over the last two days because of his involvement . 

He 's certainly is still very much part of my plans for the future . 

" At 00 , 00 or 00 you could get away with it , not having played first-team games . 

But at 00 it would be asking too much of Paul , " he said . 

Also omitted from the 00-man squad which will travel to Vaduz for Saturday 's group eight match are central defenders Alan Kernaghan and Liam Daish . 

Leeds United defender Gary Kelly is unable to travel because of a knee injury picked up in Monday 's 0-0 victory over Wimbledon at Elland Road . 

Since taking over from Jack Charlton in February , McCarthy has played largely experimental sides and seen them lose five times , draw twice and win just once . 

Squad : Alan Kelly , Shay Given , Denis Irwin , Phil Babb , Jeff Kenna , Curtis Fleming , Gary Breen , Ian Harte , Kenny Cunningham , Steve Staunton , Andy Townsend , Ray Houghton , Gareth Farrelly , Alan McLoughlin , Jason McAteer , Alan Moore , Keith O'Neill , Tony Cascarino , Niall Quinn , David Kelly .

S. African apartheid killer convicted of six murders . 

PRETORIA 0000-00-00 

South African apartheid killer Eugene de Kock was found guilty of murder and attempted murder on Tuesday , a day after he was convicted of five other murders . 

De Kock , 00 , a former police colonel who commanded a hit-squad that wiped out opponents of apartheid , is the most senior servant of white rule yet to face justice . 

Sudanese rebels say missionaries should be freed . 

Peter <OOV> 

NAIROBI 0000-00-00 

The main rebel group in south Sudan said on Tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six Roman Catholic missionaries , including three Australian nuns , held for nearly two weeks . 

George Garang , Nairobi spokesman for the Sudan People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , said it was urgently trying to contact SPLA commander <OOV> <OOV> at Mapourdit in the south to free the six . 

" The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free . 

This is a decision of the leadership , " Garang said . 

" Commander <OOV> <OOV> is a soldier so he must accept the leadership 's decision . 

But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power , " he added . 

The Catholic Information Office in Nairobi said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the SPLA with spying , spreading Islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group . 

" These charges are the interpretation of the church , " Garang said on Tuesday . " 

We have no idea why they are being held . 

We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander . " 

Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control , Garang said the rebel movement was working on the problem . 

He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at Mapourdit and were reported to be in good health . 

The Catholic Information office in Nairobi said on Monday that Australian Sisters Moira Lynch , 00 , and Mary Batchelor , 00 , American Father Michael Barton , 00 , and Sudanese Father Raphael Riel , 00 , were held in a prison in south Sudan by the SPLA . 

It said Australian Sister Maureen Carey , 00 , and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella , 00 , were held inside the compound . 

The church in Australia said on Monday Lynch , Batchelor , Barton and Riel were held in a prison until the weekend , when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound . 

The Catholic Information Office said the SPLA in the Kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August 00 . 

But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed . 

It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari , apostolic administrator of the diocese of Rumbek in southern Sudan , and an SPLA administrator and appeared in good condition . 

" On August 00 the mission was surrounded ( by the SPLA ) and sealed off . 

The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation . 

Later the mission was looted , " it added . 

An Australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were " fairly bizarre " and a matter for concern . 

He said Australian diplomats in Nairobi were working with the Roman Catholic church in southern Sudan and with U.S. and Italian diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries . 

The SPLA has fought Khartoum 's government forces in the south since 0000 for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem , Arabised north . 

OSCE postpones Bosnian municipal elections . 

SARAJEVO 0000-00-00 

The U.S. diplomat in charge of elections in Bosnia announced on Tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the Serbs in registering voters . 

Ambassador Robert Frowick , representing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , told reporters that municipal polls due on September 00 with other Bosnian elections would be put off . 

" I have made a chairman 's decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September 00 , " said Frowick . 

He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of 0000 . 

According to OSCE officials , Serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under Serb control , but which used to have Moslem majorities . 

Human rights workers say authorities in Serbia and Bosnian Serb territory have conducted a well-organised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on Serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the Dayton peace agreement . 

Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war . 

The response of the Bosnian Serbs to the OSCE 's announcement was not immediately clear . 

But Bosnian Serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed , or go ahead with their own . 

The Bosnian Serb cabinet , in a letter to the OSCE , said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be " a direct and flagrant violation fo the Dayton agreement " . 

The Serbs , who administer half of Bosnia in a Serb republic , said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections . 

Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process , which already appears set to confirm Bosnia 's ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the Dayton peace agreement had planned . 

New talks in Chechnya as Lebed waits for Yeltsin . 

Dmitry <OOV> 

<OOV> ATAGI , Russia 0000-00-00 

Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in Chechnya on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President Boris Yeltsin 's envoy Alexander Lebed . 

The Russian army commander in the region , General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov , arrived at the rebel-held village of Novye Atagi , some 00 km ( 00 miles ) south of the Chechen capital Grozny for discussions with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov . 

But Lebed himself , the Kremlin security chief , is still waiting back in Moscow to meet Yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in Chechnya . 

Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Kremlin press service as saying Yeltsin , who left for a state holiday home near Moscow on Monday , would hold no working meetings on Tuesday . 

Lebed interrupted talks with Chechnya 's separatists on a political deal on Sunday , saying he had to consult with Yeltsin . 

After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday , Lebed 's spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday . 

But Yeltsin 's spokesman rebuffed the suggestion , saying the president had left Moscow for a holiday near the capital . 

The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on Sunday . 

The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned . 

The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken . 

Tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by Lebed and Maskhadov last Thursday would be on the agenda of today 's talks . 

Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting , which started around 00.00 a.m. ( 0000 GMT ) . 

Also in Novye Atagi on Tuesday morning , was Tim Guldimann , the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) . 

Guldimann , who helped broker an earlier truce in May , was not taking part in the <OOV> talks . 

Lebed 's peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 00-month-old conflict . 

However , tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained . 

Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight , Itar-Tass news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning . 

RIA news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint Russian-Chechen police patrols in some districts of the capital Grozny on Tuesday . 

But the separatist command told Interfax news agency the patrols , part of the truce brokered by Lebed last week , would begin on Tuesday after delays for " technical reasons " . 

Yeltsin 's spokesman said he might meet officials during his break , but indicated Lebed was low on the list by saying Yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him . 

Russian news agencies also quoted the Kremlin spokesman as saying that Lebed 's representatives had not sought a meeting , hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol . 

Yeltsin , 00 , has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July , prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll , weakening his grip on affairs of state . 

Aides have dismissed such speculation , insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign . 

Some analysts say the Kremlin leader , whose order sending troops and tanks into Chechnya in 0000 started Russia 's ill-fated military campaign , could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart . 

But Lebed , who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in Moscow working against him , appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from Yeltsin . 

His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists ' demand for independence and Moscow 's insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation . 

Slovenia and Poland target EU , NATO membership . 

LJUBLJANA 0000-00-00 

Slovenia and Poland pledged to intensify cooperation on Tuesday and reinforced their determination to join the European Union and NATO at the earliest possible date . 

Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski and his Slovenian counterpart , Milan Kucan , met for talks at the start of a two-day visit to Slovenia by Kwasniewski . 

It was their fourth meeting this year . 

They said in a statement they agreed to have regular telephone contact to discuss progress in strengthening ties with the West . 

" We expect our cooperation will help both countries towards entering the European Union and NATO , " Kwasniewski said . 

" We have similar ambitions as far as our internal development and international life is concerned , " Kucan said . 

Poland and Slovenia are hoping to be among the first group of former eastern bloc countries to join the European Union and NATO . 

They have already signed an association agreement with the European Union and are both part of the Central European Free Trade Area , which also comprises Hungary , Slovakia and the Czech Republic . 

Slovenia 's trade with Poland rose to $ 000.0 million in 0000 from $ 000.0 million in 0000 . 

During his visit to Slovenia , Kwasniewski is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek , representatives of Slovenian political parties and representatives of the Chamber of Economy . 

Nationalists want Iliescu ousted for Hungary pact . 

BUCHAREST 0000-00-00 

Junior Nationalist members of Romania 's ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President Ion Iliescu for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring Hungary . 

Iliescu 's Party of Social Democracy , the senior coalition partner , immediately dismissed the National Unity Party ( PUNR ) demand as crude electioneering . 

" It is a desperate move by the PUNR , which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign , " said PDSR executive president Adrian Nastase . 

" This treaty is both necessary and good , " Nastase said , adding that the PUNR 's stance was threatening its position in the government . 

The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of Romania 's large ethnic Hungarian minority . 

It will also boost both countries ' chances of admission to NATO and the European Union . 

" If they ( the PUNR ) are so vexed , they could leave the government ... 

We might also help them to do it , if they go on like this , " he said . 

The PUNR holds four key ministries -- justice , transport , agriculture and communications . 

PUNR leader Gheorghe Funar said in a statement Iliescu , in power since the fall of communism in 0000 , should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month . 

Funar 's call came on the eve of the official launch of Iliescu 's campaign for a new term at November 0 polls . 

His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust Iliescu was unlikely to succeed , analysts said . 

Iliescu has invited political leaders to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the final form of the pact which both Romanian and Hungarian nationalists oppose for different reasons . 

Presidential officials were not available to comment on the call for Iliescu 's impeachment . 

Estonian MPS see little hope of electing president . 

Belinda Goldsmith 

TALLINN 0000-00-00 

Estonia 's parliament failed for a second time to elect a president on Tuesday , dealing a blow to incumbent Lennart Meri and pushing the country towards stalemate in its choice of a new head of state . 

Neither Meri , who oversaw Estonia 's first steps into statehood after the collapse of the Soviet Union , nor his arch-rival , former communist Arnold Ruutel , have secured the 00 votes necessary from the 000-member parliament . 

Meri garnered 00 votes and Meri 00 in Tuesday 's ballot for the five-year presidency of Estonia . 

A third and final vote was due to be held when parliament reconvened on Tuesday but legislators were not expecting a clear result . 

If there is no result the decision will be ceded to an electoral college . 

" The votes are a strong message to Meri that he is not favoured by some politicians any more , " Reform Party head <OOV> <OOV> told Reuters . 

Under a constitution agreed in 0000 , a year after independence , the president has no executive powers . 

His only political role is to smoothe the functioning of government in periods of crisis . 

But Meri , 00 , has been accused in parliament of taking too much power and not always consulting parliamentarians before making decisions . 

His relations with a <OOV> government have sometimes been tense . 

His support in the first round of voting on Monday was much lower than expected , scoring only 00 votes , which political analysts put down as a vote of no confidence in his performance . 

This support only inched up to 00 in the second vote . 

Support for Ruutel , 00 , remained constant at 00 votes . 

If the third vote fails to give either Meri or Ruutel 00 votes , the parliamentary speaker will convene an electoral college of 000 MPs and 000 local goverment representatives to hold a new poll that could include new nominations . 

This would be the first time that the former Soviet republic has had to call together an electoral college . 

In its first presidential election in 0000 Meri won the necessary votes in in a parliamentary election against Ruutel . 

Parliamentary organisers said the exact timetable remained unclear but it would probably take about a month to organise an electoral college which could also hold several rounds of voting before a clear winner emerges . 

Estonia assembly fails to elect state president . 

TALLINN 0000-00-00 

The Estonian parliament failed for a third and final time to elect a new state president on Tuesday , refusing a second mandate for incumbent Lennart Meri . 

Neither Meri nor his rival Arnold Ruutel could garner the 00 votes needed from the 000 members of parliament to become president . 

In the third vote Meri won 00 and Ruutel won 00 votes . 

The final decision will now be made by a larger assembly . 

Meri won 00 in a second vote earlier on Tuesday and 00 in the first on Monday . 

Ruutel won 00 votes in the first two secret ballots . 

Enn <OOV> , chairman of the National Election Commission said 00 members of parliament cast votes , with one ballot paper invalid and 00 abstentions . 

The election will now go before an electoral college involving MPs and local government representatives that will be convened by the parliamentary Speaker in the next day or so . 

It could take up to a month before a new vote but the timetable is not yet clear . 

This is the first time the former Soviet republic has had to convene such a group . 

Albania charges Briton with child sex abuse . 

TIRANA 0000-00-00 

Albanian authorities have arrested and charged a British man for sexually abusing two young boys , a Tirana prosecutor said on Tuesday . 

" We have arrested him and charged him with these shameful acts of sex abuse of little children , " prosecutor Adnan <OOV> told Reuters .

Thompson has denied the charges . 

He could face up to five years in jail if convicted .

Estonia assembly again fails to elect president . 

TALLINN 0000-00-00 

Estonia 's parliament again failed to elect a new state president on Tuesday when neither of two candidates secured a majority in second-round voting . 

Incumbent president Lennart Meri won 00 votes compared to 00 won by his rival , deputy Parliamentary Speaker Arnold Ruutel . 

But Meri 's support was not enough for the 00 needed for election and a third secret ballot will take place later in the day ( 0000 GMT ) , parliamentary officials said . 

To win a clear mandate for the five-year presidential term , a candidate must secure 00 votes from the 000-member parliament . 

Enn <OOV> , Chairman of the National Election Commission , said 00 members of parliament voted in the second round , with 00 abstentions and one ballot paper invalid . 

On Monday , in the first round of voting , Meri secured 00 votes and Ruutel 00 . 

Meri 's popularity has suffered in recent years , with politicians criticising him for taking too much power and acting without consulting parliament . 

If a third round of voting fails to give either candidate 00 votes , the parliamentary speaker has to convene an electoral college of all 000 MPs and 000 local government representatives for a new vote that could take up to a month .

BRATISLAVA 0000-00-00 

Marc Dutroux , the chief accused in Belgium 's sensational child murder and sex abuse case , visited Slovakia a number of times and about 00 young Slovak women went to Belgium at his invitation , police said on Tuesday . 

But they have difficulty remembering what happened there , perhaps because of drugs , and are unsure whether they were filmed for pornography , Rudolf Gajdos , head of the Slovak office of Interpol , told Reuters . 

Although Gajdos spoke of " girls " his deputy , Eva <OOV> , said the case involved about 00 young women in their early <OOV> . 

" The police interrogated several Slovak girls who said that they had been invited by Mark Dutroux to visit Belgium , " Gajdos said . 

" The girls said they went to Belgium voluntarily and the police suspect that they were used to act in pornographic films . " 

" The police suspect ( the girls ) were under the influence of drugs as some girls admitted they took unspecified pills . " 

" We have suspicions of a rape , but the police still have to find the victim , " Gajdos added . 

Dutroux 's last visit to Slovakia was reported to have been as recent as July . 

Slovak police are also cooperating with Belgium in the search for An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks , who went missing last August . 

Dutroux , 00 , who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two other girls aged 00 and 00 , is one of several suspects in the Marchal and Lambrecks case . 

Last Saturday he led police to the bodies of two other girls , aged eight , who died of starvation this year after their abduction in June , 0000 . 

The Czech office of Interpol said on Friday it would neither confirm nor deny that Dutroux had been in the Czech Republic , Slovakia 's western neighbour and former federation partner . 

Belgian police said an officer had visited Bratislava to talk with Slovak detectives about An and Eefje and other disappearances , and he planned to go also to Prague .

Russian serial killer strikes again . 

MOSCOW 0000-00-00 

Russian police in the Urals city of Perm are on the trail of a serial killer who has claimed his seventh victim in just a few months , Itar-Tass news agency said on Tuesday .

MOSCOW 0000-00-00 

Russia 's military commander in Chechnya began new talks with separatist chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov on Tuesday , Itar-Tass news agency said . 

Tass said the talks were taking place in the settlement of Novye Atagi , some 00 km ( 00 miles ) south of the Chechen capital Grozny . 

The talks had been postponed while the Russians waited for the rebels to return arms and ammunition seized from Russian soldiers at the weekend . 

The Chechens said on Monday they had returned all the weapons , which they said were seized by a renegade group . 

The talks between Maskhadov and Russia 's Vyacheslav Tikhomirov are aimed at putting the finishing touches to a ceasefire sealed last week in talks with Russian security chief Alexander Lebed . 

Lebed , who met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday to discuss the progress he made on a political settlement for the breakaway region , has been seeking a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin , who started a holiday near Moscow on Monday . 

Argentine bishop reminds cabinet of Commandments . 

BUENOS AIRES , Argentina 0000-00-00 

The Archbishop of Buenos Aires said on Tuesday the first thing he would do if elected president of Argentina would be to put up posters of the Ten Commandments in government offices . 

" They asked me what would be the first thing I would do if I were president , and I said the first thing I would do would be to resign straight away , " Archbishop Antonio <OOV> said at a sermon attended by several cabinet ministers . 

" But before going , I would have big signs put up in all government offices , those to do with justice , in all sectors , with the Ten Commandments , " he added .

Dutch government wo n't pay ransom for kidnap victims . 

SAN JOSE , Costa Rica 0000-00-00 

The Netherlands government has ruled out paying ransom money for a Dutch couple kidnapped from their farm , while Costa Rican authorities said on Tuesday they had no leads in the case . 

" We have not had contact with the kidnappers nor do we have any leads to take us to where they might be held , " Chief of Judicial Police Manuel Alvarado told Reuters . 

<OOV> <OOV> Zylstra and his wife , <OOV> <OOV> Coers , both 00 , were abducted from the teak plantation they managed late Saturday or early Sunday by at least two men demanding $ 0.0 million ransom , authorities said . 

Costa Rican officials on Monday had given different names for the couple . 

Anton Schutte , an official with the embassy for Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg , said the Dutch government had ruled out paying any money in ransom . " 

We 're looking at a criminal act that has no political aspect as far as what we can tell , " Schutte added . 

A note with the ransom demand was left in the couple 's car , which was used in the kidnapping , Schutte told a news conference on Monday . 

He said the note , believed to have been hand-written in Spanish and signed by the victims , was addressed to <OOV> Huizinga , another Dutch citizen who owns the tree plantation . " 

Depending on you , we will either live or die , " it said . 

Alvarado said the car was abandoned about 00 miles ( 00 km ) north of the couple 's house but said that did not indicate the kidnappers intended to take their victims into neighbouring Nicaragua . 

The farm is in the border region where a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped last New Year 's Eve by a heavily armed band led by a former Nicaraguan guerrilla . 

The two were held for 00 days until relatives paid a ransom . 

Two of the suspected abductors have since been arrested . 

Venezuela unions harden towards CVG privatization . 

CARACAS 0000-00-00 

A swell of protest is growing within Venezuela 's trade unions at the proposed year-end privatization of the state-owned holding company Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana ( CVG ) , CVG union leaders said Tuesday . 

" We oppose the way the government is proceeding with the sale , " Ramon <OOV> , <OOV> trade union Secretary General and member of <OOV> opposition party Radical Cause , told reporters . 

" We do n't believe the government will make its timetable , " he added . 

<OOV> is the CVG 's steel-producing arm , slated for a December sale worth an estimated $ 0.0 billion . 

The CVG 's aluminum companies <OOV> and <OOV> are also scheduled to be sold early 0000 . 

Arguing that CVG 's privatization would result in some 00,000 layoffs , compared to the government 's estimated 0,000 , CVG 's union leaders told reporters they would strike and stage protests if their concerns were not addressed . 

" We oppose any privatization that hurts workers ' welfare and does not take into account its social impact , " they said . 

The opposition party Radical Cause controls all of the unionized workers at the CVG heavy industry complex and has systematically opposed all government legislation in congress .

Nicaraguan drunks fear " <OOV> " bandit . 

MANAGUA , Nicaragua 0000-00-00 

Heavy drinkers in a Nicaraguan city were searching for someone who has covered them in " <OOV> " while they were passed out in a drunken stupor , a local newspaper reported on Tuesday . 

The dreaded " <OOV> " -- " <OOV> " -- preys on men who have passed out in the streets of Matagalpa , 00 miles ( 000 kms ) north of Managua , placing <OOV> " <OOV> " on various parts of their bodies , El Nuevo Diario reported . 

Enraged drunks and street people in this town known for its machismo have organised a so-far unsuccessful search for the culprit who finds victims in the dark streets surrounding a local market . 

The total number of victims was still unknown . 

The first of the victims were two vagrants who slept in an abandoned car in front of a local bank , the newspaper said . 

In spite of the collective fear gripping Matagalpa 's drinkers , local women expressed little sympathy . 

" Its just desserts for all the ' <OOV> ' ( drunkards ) who sleep in the streets of our beautiful town , " said a woman who worked in the local market . 

Brazil likely to turn Banespa federal bank - paper . 

SAO PAULO 0000-00-00 

Brazil is likely to turn Sao Paulo state bank Banespa into a federal bank in a prior step to privatization , according to unnamed government sources , O Globo daily said . 

The newspaper said the Central Bank special administration of Banespa ends in December 00 and after that the bank has to be liquidated or turned into a federal bank since there are no conditions to return Banespa to Sao Paulo state government . 

A Central Bank spokesman said he could not confirm or deny the report . 

Banespa has been under central bank special temporary administration since December 0000 . 

The central bank management could be lifted if Sao Paulo state decided to take part in the recent federal government 's plan to restructure state banks . 

Under the plan , the federal government would provide 000 percent of the financing needed to restructure debt of state banks being privatized , liquidated or turned into development banks . 

It also offers to refinance up to 00 percent of the debt held by state banks whose governments decide to keep control of their banks . 

Although the plan was designed under terms proposed by Sao Paulo state governor Mario Covas , he has showed no interest in taking part in the plan because Sao Paulo 's debt with Banespa has increased sharply , O Globo said . 

Sao Paulo state 's debt is now estimated at 00 billion <OOV> . 

O Globo also said another delicate case to be solved involves private bank Bamerindus . 

The newspaper said Bamerindus has sent to the Central Bank a proposal for restructuring combined with a request for a 00-day credit line , paying four percent a year plus the Basic Interest Rate of the Central Bank ( TBC ) . 

O Globo also said the loan would give Bamerindus time to sell assets . 

Bamerindus , Brazil 's fourth-largest private bank , has been facing liquidity troubles . 

Bamerindus declined to comment on negotiations being held with the Central Bank .

Former Argentine benevolent dictator Alejandro Lanusse dies . 

BUENOS AIRES 0000-00-00 

Alejandro Lanusse , the former dictator who ruled Argentina for two years , died at age 00 on Monday . 

Lanusse died after being brought to a hospital a week ago following a fall at home that resulted in a blood clot in the brain . 

He was operated on earlier in the week but failed to recover from surgery . 

The former dictator , who ruled from 0000 to 0000 , was best known for allowing Juan Domingo Peron , Argentina 's famed populist leader , to return to Argentina after 00 years of forced exile . 

Lanusse took over the leadership of the country after five years of dictatorship . 

But unlike his two predecessors , Juan Carlos <OOV> and Marcelo Levingston , who ruled Argentina with an iron hand , Lanusse steered the country toward democracy . 

That resulted in general elections in March 0000 when the Peronists led by Hector Campora and Vicente Solano Lima returned to power . 

Lanusse was a candidate in the election but failed to defeat his old <OOV> and never returned to public office . 

He was imprisoned for four years in 0000 for taking part in a coup attempt to overthrow Peron led by General Benjamin Menendez . 

Lanusse 's rule saw the gradual rise of left-wing activism which culminated in another period of brutal Argentine dictatorship from 0000 to 0000 , during which the military launched its " dirty war " that resulted in 00,000 missing people . 

In his autobiography published in 0000 , Lanusse described himself as a military man with " democratic ideas . " 

He was born in Buenos Aires in 0000 and married Ileana Bell with whom he had nine children . 

He entered the Military College in 0000 .

S. Korea asked to stop China-bound missionaries . 

BEIJING 0000-00-00 

Beijing has called on Seoul to stop South Korean missionaries from travelling to China , a South Korean embassy spokesman said on Tuesday . 

The appeal was made on Sunday during talks between South Korean deputy Foreign Minister Lee <OOV> and his Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan , the spokesman said . 

It is not known why China raised the issue . 

Atheist China officially bans missionary activities but often turns a blind eye to religious activities of people nominally employed as foreign language teachers , particularly in remote areas that are unable to attract other candidates . 

Hong Kong nabs blind 00-year-old illegal immigrant . 

HONG KONG 0000-00-00 

A blind 00-year-old boy from China sneaked over the border into Hong Kong and was arrested as an illegal immigrant , Hong Kong police said on Tuesday . 

He was caught by police trying to force his way into a home in the rural New Territories , a police spokesman said . 

" The boy came from China 's eastern province of Jiangsu . 

He was spotted by a passerby trying to climb into an apartment in the early hours of Monday morning , " the spokesman said . 

No decision has yet been made on how to deal with the boy . 

Hong Kong police regularly catch hundreds of illegal immigrants and people who have overstayed their visas from mainland China and send them back . 

Hong Kong , a British colony , reverts to Chinese control next year but will remain sealed off from the mainland except to a tiny trickle of legal immigrants and people with special visit permits . 

Bosnian premier in Turkey for one day visit . 

ANKARA 0000-00-00 

Bosnian Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic arrived in Ankara on Tuesday for an official visit where he is due to discuss Turkey 's aid to the former Yugoslav republic . 

The premier , who is due to meet his Turkish counterpart Necmettin Erbakan on Tuesday , will also be discussing the postponed Bosnian elections , a foreign ministry official said . 

A small number of Bosnians had also begun to vote in Turkey . 

Muratovic is also due to meet with President Suleyman Demirel , Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller and Turkish businessman , the ministry official said . 

He will leave on Thursday .

He said no new date had been set yet . 

" Turkish people are watching closely the developments in Bosnia . 

We have seen elections as a step in the normalisation process , " the foreign ministry official said . 

New U.N. relief coordinator arrives in Iraq . 

Leon <OOV> 

BAGHDAD 0000-00-00 

A new U.N. relief coordinator has arrived in Baghdad to take up the task of organising humanitarian goods distribution and to face Iraq 's continuing opposition over the number of international monitors to be involved . 

U.N. and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that <OOV> General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had appointed Italian Gualtiero Fulcheri and sent him to Iraq last week to replace Moroccan Mohamed Zejjari . 

One diplomat said Iraq and U.N. were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under Baghdad 's oil deal with <OOV> . 

" The United Nations would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors . 

Baghdad says it can only accept a few dozens , " said the diplomat . 

Baghdad holds that the <OOV> memorandum of understanding on partial oil sales signed last June does not specify how many foreign observers should be stationed in Iraq . 

" Observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them , " said another diplomat . 

Iraq 's partial oil sales pact with U.N. , allowing crude exports worth $ 0 billion every six months , gives U.N. the right to supervise the purchase and distribution of food supplies in the country . 

The deal is a humanitarian exception to the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 0000 which include a ban on its oil exports . 

Fulcheri declined comment on the differences between the U.N. and Iraq , saying only : " There are several different things which still need to be done . " 

Fulcheri started his U.N. career in 0000 and has long experience in U.N. emergency relief in Congo , Angola , Sudan and Somalia .

Anti-abortion speaker praises Democrat tolerance . 

Alan Elsner 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

An anti-abortion politician addressed the Democratic convention on Tuesday , but praised the overwhelmingly pro-abortion rights party for its tolerance of his minority views . 

Rep . 

Tony Hall of Ohio said he and other Democrats who opposed abortion had always felt left out in their own party . 

" But this year is different . 

For the first time , the Democratic Party has included in our platform a conscience clause , " he said . 

The clause recognizes and welcomes Democrats with divergent views on abortion and states they have a full part to play at all levels of the party . 

" The Democratic Party is indeed the party of true inclusiveness , " Hall said . 

At its convention four years ago , organizers prevented then Pennsylvania Gov . 

Robert Casey , a vehement opponent of abortion , from speaking . 

Republicans have used their decision as an example of Democrat intolerance ever since . 

Casey told a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down . 

Democratic leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak . 

" I believe the Democratic party ought to be <OOV> , <OOV> and pro-life , " Casey said . 

" I asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the Democrat National Convention . 

For the second time in four years , my request fell on deaf ears , " he said . 

The Republican Party , whose platform calls for making all abortions illegal , faced a similar dilemma this year when Massachusetts Gov . 

William Weld asked to deliver a speech defending abortion rights and was turned down . 

Bob Dole , the Republican presidential nominee , tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party 's platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights . 

Democrats also heard Tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights . 

Kate Michelman , president of the National Abortion Rights Action League , described how she had an abortion at a time when the procedure was illegal after her husband abandoned her with three young children . 

" I 'm here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth . 

The message from the Republican Party is one of disdain . 

Their answer to choice is control and punishment . 

Our answer is trust , compassion and respect , " she said . 

Georgia Rep . 

Cynthia McKinney said : " You make your moral decisions . 

I 'll make mine and let 's leave ( Republican House Speaker ) Newt Gingrich out of it . "

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

An ABC News poll released on Tuesday showed President Bill Clinton 's lead over Republican challenger Bob Dole stretching to 00 points in advance of the Nov. 0 election . 

The poll , taken on Sunday and Monday as the president engaged in a whistle-stop train trip to the Democratic Convention in Chicago , put Clinton at 00 percent , Dole at 00 percent and Ross Perot of the Reform Party at 0 percent . 

A similar poll conducted on Saturday and Sunday had showed a nine point lead for Clinton , ahead by 00-00 percent . 

Dole , down by around 00 points in early August in ABC polls , had closed to within four percentage points immediately after the Republican convention in San Diego earlier in August .

ABC said a parallel poll of 000 likely voters showed the president ahead by 00 points , with Clinton at 00 percent , Dole at 00 percent and Perot at 0 percent . 

The poll of registered voters showed a shift in favor of the Democrats in the elections for House of Representatives , with 00 percent saying that if the vote were today they would go for a Democrat and 00 percent opting for a Republican .

The poll indicated a fall in the number of people who believed Dole would be able to fulfil his promise to cut the federal budget deficit and cut income taxes by 00 percent at the same time . 

It showed 00 percent believed it possible compared to 00 who believed it was n't . 

That compared to 00-00 in the previous poll .

CALCUTTA 0000-00-00 

Mother Teresa spent her 00th birthday in a Calcutta hospital bed on Tuesday as tributes to the legendary missionary poured in from around the world . 

Doctors said that later in the day they would try to wean the Nobel Peace Prize laureate from the respirator that has aided her breathing for the past six days . 

" Her condition seems to be better , but the danger remains as long as she is on respirator , " an official at Woodlands Nursing Home said . " 

She is conscious but her breathing is irregular . " 

The revered Roman Catholic nun was admitted to the Calcutta hospital a week ago with high fever and severe vomiting . 

She later suffered heart failure and was diagnosed with malaria . 

Her fever has since abated and the heart failure has been brought under control , but her heart continues to beat irregularly , doctors said . 

" Unless she breathes on her own , I would advise you to keep your fingers crossed , " said a doctor who was familiar with her case but not part of the six-member team treating Mother Teresa . 

The nun 's birthday prompted greetings , bouquets and prayers from around the world . 

Pope John Paul II and Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy sent her get-well messages , the Press Trust of India said . 

" Ask for a miracle .

All of us know about her . 

She is like a goddess , " said Raju , 0 , who has a mother but no father . 

The Statesman newspaper quoted 00-year-old Mangala Das , paralysed from her waist down and a resident of the Prem Dan ( Gift of Love ) home for the destitute , as saying she and her friends had been praying incessantly for Mother Teresa 's recovery . 

<OOV> Das , 00 , was picked up from a Calcutta footpath a week ago by passers-by who took pity on him and brought him to Nirmal <OOV> ( Immaculate Home ) . 

" I do not know who she is . 

I have never seen her , but I can only bless her for what she has done for people like me , " Das told The Statesman . 

Mother Teresa 's condition improved on Sunday as her fever abated , and on Monday she was able to scribble notes to doctors and nuns . 

Thousands in Calcutta , where she founded her Missionaries of Charity religious order in 0000 , prayed for her recovery . 

Ministers of the communist government of West Bengal state and people of different religions joined Catholics to pray for Mother Teresa 's recovery at Mother House . 

" We joined the prayer to express our solidarity with her work for the cause of the poor and downtrodden , " said Nanda Gopal Bhattacharya , a communist minister in West Bengal . 

Islamists can meet in London , minister . 

ISLAMABAD 0000-00-00 

British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday that his government would only take action against a planned conference of Islamist groups in London if British law was broken . 

" People who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in Britain , " Rifkind , in Pakistan for a visit , told Reuters . " 

As long as they obey our laws then that is not something the government would normally interfere with . " 

The Islamist conference , due to be held in London on September 0 , has caused concern in countries such as Algeria and Egypt , which are fighting armed Islamic militants . 

British Jewish groups have also protested because they say members of Algeria 's Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) and the Palestinian Islamic group Hamas are on the guest list . 

Rifkind said it was for the home secretary ( interior minister ) to act by denying visas to participants if he felt there was reason to believe that they might break the law . 

" Our policy has to be fundamentally based on respect for the rule of law and insistence that it be observed , " he said .

Afghan leader tells U.S. Congressman of peace plan .

KABUL 0000-00-00 

Afghan government military chief Ahmad Shah Masood briefed visiting U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher on Tuesday on a peace plan for his wartorn country . 

A spokesman for Masood said he had told the California Republican at a meeting in northern Kabul that President Burhanuddin Rabbani 's government favoured talks with all Afghan factions to set up an interim government . 

The factions should agree to appoint a transitional leader , draft a new constitution , collect heavy weapons , create a national army and hold free elections in which the transitional leader would be barred from standing , he added . 

Rohrabacher flew into Bagram military airbase north of Kabul in a Red Cross plane on Tuesday after meeting northern opposition militia leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum . 

Masood 's spokesman <OOV> ( one name ) said Rohrabacher had recently visited Italy , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan as part of a mission to promote peace in Afghanistan . 

" We are certainly serious more than before to find a solution to the Afghan problem and support every U.N. plan , " <OOV> quoted Rohrabacher as saying . 

However , a spokesman for Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , a long-time rival of Masood , expressed concern at signs of renewed U.S. interest in Afghanistan . 

" America wants to block the establishment of a strong Islamic government in Afghanistan and the U.S. intends to neutralise the Afghan peace process initiated by the Afghans themselves , " said the spokesman , Hamid Ibrahimi . 

" A great game has been started in Afghanistan as America feels that Tehran and Moscow have got stronger in the Afghan picture -- something Washington wants to change , " he said . 

Rohrabacher was expected to visit neutral faction leaders in the eastern city of Jalalabad and meet leaders of the rebel Islamic Taleban militia in the southern city of Kandahar . 

Afghan guerrilla factions have been locked in a bloody power struggle since the fall of the communist government in April 0000 . 

Hekmatyar , once Rabbani 's main rival , made a peace pact with him and rejoined the government as prime minister in June .

Egypt confiscates paper for " mad rulers " article . 

CAIRO 0000-00-00 

Egypt has banned and confiscated 00,000 copies of the Cyprus-based Arabic monthly newspaper <OOV> because of an editorial suggesting mental health tests for Arab leaders , the editor-in-chief said on Tuesday . 

Mohamed Abu <OOV> , said Information Ministry censors had told him to send all the copies of the August edition back to Cyprus at his own expense . 

He told Reuters the reason was his own front-page editorial , entitled " A Chronic Mental Illness " in which he attacks compliant Arab leaders for serving U.S. and Israeli interests . 

" The Arabs demand that our Arab leaders undergo a compulsory examination by a team of psychiatrists to see how sound their mental capacities are , " the editorial said . 

" Because our leaders have started to behave with extreme hostility towards the interests of their peoples to court the goodwill of the Americans and the Zionists , " he added . 

The censorship office denied they had confiscated the newspapers but declined to say when they could go on sale .

Wife of gun victim Brady praises Clinton . 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

Sarah Brady , whose Republican husband was severely disabled in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan , took centre stage at the Democratic National convention on Monday night to praise President Bill Clinton 's gun control efforts . 

With her husband James sitting in a wheelchair to the side of the podium , Mrs. Brady called the handgun control bill that a Democratic Congress passed and Clinton signed in 0000 a major step in controlling firearm violence in the United States . 

But she said more had to be done . 

The <OOV> walked on to the stage , he on her arm and with the aid of a cane , to a rousing reception from the convention . 

Their teenaged son sat in a VIP box with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and watched as his father returned to his wheelchair . 

" Jim , we must have made a wrong turn . 

This is n't San Diego ( site of the Republican convention ) , " Mrs. Brady joked to her husband , who was serving as Reagan 's press secretary when he was shot . 

" Sarah , I told you this is the Democratic convention , " he responded to his wife , who before the shooting had worked for two Republican congressmen and the Republican national party . 

" Since the Brady Law went into effect on February 00 , 0000 ( it ) has stopped more than 000,000 convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers from buying a handgun . 

Today , and every day , the Brady Law is stopping an estimated 00 felons from buying a handgun , " Mrs. Brady said . 

She added , " But we need to do more . 

We should , as President Clinton proposed today , stop people convicted of domestic violence from buying a handgun . 

Jim and I join with you tonight in saluting the great job that President Clinton has done in fighting crime and gun violence . " 

" He 's a hunter and a sportsman , but he understands the difference between a Remington rifle and an <OOV> . 

And he knows that you do n't go hunting with an Uzi . 

Mr. President you deserve our thanks . " 

Jim Brady then gave a big thumbs to the audience . 

Brady 

was shot in the head in 0000 by gunman John Hinckley , who tried to kill Reagan in a deranged bid to impress Jodie Foster , an actress he never met but with whom he was obsessed . 

The Brady bill , calling for a waiting period before someone could buy a gun so a background check could be made , was first introduced in Congress in 0000 but it took seven years to pass because of opposition from the National Rifle Association gun lobby .

Most hostages freed from hijacked Sudanese plane . 

STANSTED , England 0000-00-00 

Armed hijackers believed to be Iraqis released 000 people on Tuesday from a Sudan Airways plane carrying 000 passengers and crew that landed in London after being diverted on a flight from Khartoum to Amman , police said . 

Police spokesman Roger <OOV> said the six or seven hijackers remained on board the aircraft , which arrived from Cyprus at 0.00 a.m. ( 0000 GMT ) . 

He said they had made various requests to police negotiators but stepped back from earlier suggestions that the hijackers had asked to speak to a British-based Iraqi police named as Mr <OOV> . 

The hijackers , who have said they want to seek asylum in Britain , are believed to be armed with grenades and possibly other explosives , according to police . 

They earlier threatened to blow up the aircraft . 

The Airbus <OOV> was diverted first to Cyprus , then to Britain .

Hijacked Sudan plane lands at a London airport . 

STANSTED , England 0000-00-00 

A hijacked Sudan Airways plane carrying 000 passengers and crew landed at Stansted airport just outside London early on Tuesday morning after flying from Cyprus , eyewitnesses said . 

The Airbus 000 Flight 000 , which was hijacked on Monday evening on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman , landed at 0.00 a.m. ( 0000 GMT ) after a flight of more than four hours . 

At least one of the unidentified hijackers was apparently armed with grenades and TNT and threatened to blow the plane up in Cyprus unless it was refuelled so they could fly to Britain to claim political asylum . 

" They will surrender the passengers there and surrender themselves , " police spokesman Glafcos Xenos told reporters at Cyprus 's Larnaca airport . 

Security was tight at Stansted airport , which is about 00 miles ( 00 km ) northeast of the capital . 

Stansted has been designated as the preferred option for handling hijackings in southern England because it is more remote than Heathrow and Gatwick , London 's two major airports , and handles less air traffic . 

Hijacked Sudan plane expected at London 's Stansted . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

A hijacked Sudan Airways plane with 000 passengers and crew on board was expected to land at London 's Stansted airport later on Tuesday morning , a police spokeswoman said . 

" That is the plan at the moment . 

That is where the plane is being directed to , " Ruth Collin of Essex police , the force responsible for Stansted , said . 

Stansted , London 's <OOV> airport after Heathrow and Gatwick , is located about 00 miles ( 00 km ) northeast of the capital . 

British officials said they would much prefer to deal with a hijacking at Stansted because of its relatively remote location and because air traffic would be less badly disrupted there than at Heathrow or Gatwick . 

They said police and the emergency services were implementing a well-rehearsed contingency plan to handle the hijacking . 

The armed hijackers of the Airbus 000 Flight 000 , which is expected to arrive about 0 a.m. ( 0000 GMT ) , have said they intend to surrender and seek political asylum in Britain . 

The plane was hijacked on its way from Khartoum to the Jordanian capital Amman on Monday evening and landed at Larnaca airport in Cyprus to refuel . 

The identity and number of the hijackers was not known . 

One of them negotiated through the pilot in English . 

The pilot said several hijackers appeared to be placed around the plane . 

Painted parrot scam lands Australian in jail . 

PERTH , Australia 0000-00-00 

A conman who painted common Australian parrots with dye to make them look like rare birds worth thousands of dollars was jailed for fraud on Tuesday . 

Denham Peiris painted six green parrots , worth about A$ 000 ( US$ 00 ) a pair , with a cinnamon hair dye and traded them as Indian <OOV> Parrots , valued at A$ 00,000 a pair . 

Peiris , 00 , of Perth , was sentenced in the Western Australian District Court to two years in jail for fraud after trading three pairs of impostor birds for 00 parrots worth a total of A$ 00,000 . 

" Everyone was fooled , " said pet shop owner Shane Drew , who unknowingly traded the disguised birds . 

" I 'd already had three local breeders have a look at them and sent photos and videos of the birds to the eastern states for authentication -- they said they 're nice birds , " Drew told reporters outside court . 

" After I was told they were dyed , I checked them over again . 

It was a perfect paint job except for one feather under a wing of one bird that was only half dyed , " Drew said . 

Drew said Peiris , a bird enthusiast , would have succeeded with the fraud if he had not tried to trade a fourth pair of bogus birds after an associate had told police of the scam . 

If not for the informant , the painted parrots ' true colours would not have been known for six months , he said . 

" They <OOV> in the summer , so five or six months down the track , I would have looked like the guilty party , " Drew said . 

NZ motorist 's arrest brings free flight to Tonga .

A New Zealand motorist got an unexpected free flight to Tonga on Tuesday after being caught drinking and driving .

He spun the wheels so much that the tyres caught alight and smoke began pouring from under the bonnet , the New Zealand Press Association reported .

Seoul embassies warned of terrorist attacks . 

SEOUL 0000-00-00 

South Korea has told its overseas missions to step up security since its embassy in the former Yugoslavia received a threat over Seoul 's crackdown on radical students , the foreign ministry said on Tuesday . 

A letter to the Belgrade embassy on Monday under the name of the Macedonian Communist Party demanded South Korea release detained student leaders , a ministry spokesman said . 

" The letter said the party would assault the embassy , other South <OOV> facilities and Korean nationals unless our authorities released arrested students , " he said . 

Nearly 000 members of an outlawed student group were arrested after violent protests demanding reunification with communist North Korea were crushed by riot police at a Seoul university this month . 

Authorities branded the violence , in which a police officer was killed , as an act of terror . 

" The ministry has ordered the embassy to take urgent security measures against possible terrorist attacks , " the official said , asking not to be named . 

It had called for similar precautions at other overseas missions , including those in Canada and Bangladesh where leftist groups have staged protests over the crackdown . 

Nuclear pact will be a step to <OOV> . 

BEIJING 0000-00-00 

China on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by India last week , saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament . 

" Although the final draft of the treaty probably did n't totally satisfy any country , it was in general balanced , " the official People 's Daily newspaper said in a commentary . 

India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva , saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament . 

New Delhi 's stance , which was seen as effectively thwarting 0-0/0 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament , drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism . 

India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly . 

China said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations . 

" The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament , " it said . 

China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord . 

The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance . 

" Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons , " it said . 

China held on July 00 what it said would be its last nuclear test before a self-imposed moratorium that took effect the following day . 

China was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing . 

Japan declares food poisoning threat receding . 

TOKYO 0000-00-00 

The government said on Tuesday that the threat from a mysterious killer germ , while still requiring vigilance , appears to be receding in the western Japan city of Sakai , where the epidemic hit the hardest . 

The food poisoning epidemic caused by the <OOV> colon bacillus in Sakai appears to be " settling down " , Health Minister Naoto Kan was quoted by a government spokesman as telling the cabinet . 

The <OOV> colon bacillus has been found responsible for a widespread food poisoning epidemic that has killed 00 people and made over 0,000 ill this year . 

Sakai , near the regional commercial centre of Osaka , has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria , with nearly 0,000 , mostly schoolchildren , affected by the disease . 

Two children in Sakai have died from complications associated with the bacteria . 

Kan told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday that no new victims have been reported since August 0 , indicating that the peak has passed , at least for Sakai . 

Sakai officials agreed with the assessment , but said it was too early to feel relieved . 

" There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with , " a city spokesman said , citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September . 

Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in Sakai , but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection . 

The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and <OOV> plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation 's school lunch programme . 

The ministers agreed at Tuesday 's cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October , when schools around the country resume . 

Japan 's Agriculture Ministry also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on U.S. government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic . 

As of Monday , 00 children were still hospitalised in Sakai city , of whom six were in serious condition . 

Japan aluminium shipments surge 0.0 pct in July . 

TOKYO 0000-00-00 

Japanese shipments of aluminium mill products in July surged 0.0 percent over the same month last year to 000,000 tonnes , while production rose 0.0 percent to 000,000 tonnes , according to preliminary data released on Tuesday by the Japan Aluminium Federation . 

The surge reflected strong demand from the beverage can and housing construction sectors , federation officials said . 

Figures released two weeks ago from Japan 's seven largest mills already showed that Japan 's can sheet output reached its highest monthly level ever in July , reflecting above-average temperatures that sparked a jump in beer consumption . 

A federation official added that the half-year through September 0000 also appeared likely to set a new record for can production , despite cooler temperatures in August . 

July inventories stood at 00,000 tonnes , down 0.0 percent from the prior month . 

July foil output was off 0.0 percent year-on-year at 00,000 tonnes , while foil shipments fell 0.0 percent to 00,000 tonnes . 

June mill output data were revised slightly downward to 000,000 tonnes from the preliminary 000,000 , while shipments were revised marginally upward to 000,000 tonnes from 000,000 . 

Final figures for June pegged can stock shipments at 00,000 tonnes , up 0.0 percent year-on-year . 

Shipments to the auto sector fell 0.0 percent to 00,000 tonnes , while the construction sector rose 0.0 percent to 00,000 tonnes . 

Exports dipped 0.0 percent to 00,000 tonnes .

China thanks Gabon for support on human rights . 

BEIJING 0000-00-00 

China has publicly thanked Gabon for its strong support at the United Nations Human Rights Commission , where Beijing has come under attack from Western nations for its human rights record . 

China 's President Jiang Zemin offered his gratitude in a meeting on Monday with visiting Gabon President Omar Bongo , the official Xinhua news agency said . 

Jiang also acknowledged the Central African nation 's support for China 's stance on Taiwan , which Beijing views as a renegade province , while Bongo was quoted as thanking China for economic and technological aid , the agency said late on Monday . 

In April , China quashed a draft resolution by the U.N. Human Rights Commission expressing concern over continuing reports of Beijing 's violations of fundamental freedoms . 

After the defeat of the resolution , drafted by the European Union and the United States , China 's Foreign Ministry thanked 00 countries for backing its motion for " no action " on the document . 

It was the sixth year in a row that China avoided censure at the U.N. 's main human rights forum . 

China has been accused of a wide range of human rights abuses , often in violation of its own legal code , in an effort to silence dissent . 

A Xinhua commentary earlier this year said a plot by the West to force its human rights standards and values on other countries was doomed to failure . 

Taiwan 's Cooperative Bank cuts prime lending rate . 

TAIPEI 0000-00-00 

Cooperative Bank of Taiwan , one of the island 's leading state-run banks , said it was cutting its prime lending rate by 0.00 percentage point , effective on Tuesday . 

The bank said in a statement it was cutting its prime lending rate to 0.00 percent from 0.00 percent . 

It also would cut its <OOV> time deposit rates by between 0.00 and 0.00 percentage points . 

The moves made Cooperative the first major bank to cut rates in response to a call on Friday from central bank governor Sheu Yuan-dong . 

In the central bank 's latest bid to jumpstart Taiwan 's sluggish economy , Sheu ordered a reduction of up to a half-percentage point in banks ' reserve requirements and called on commercial banks to pass on the savings in the form of interest rate reductions .

Palestinians to strike over Jerusalem demolition . 

JERUSALEM 0000-00-00 

Palestinian leaders in Jerusalem called on Tuesday for a two-hour strike to protest what they called Israel 's war on Arab East Jerusalem after police demolished a building there . 

Israeli police demolished a 00 metre ( yard ) by 00 metre structure in Jerusalem 's Old City they said had been built with funding from the Palestinian self-rule Authority for use as a social club . 

Police used a huge crane to lift a bulldozer over the Old City 's walls to reach the building amidst narrow alleys , witnesses said . 

Bystanders at the scene said work had begun on the building in 0000 and it had yet to be completed when the Israeli police bulldozed it . 

The Palestinian Authority was set up under the 0000 PLO-Israel interim peace deal . 

" There has been a call for a general strike between one ( 0000 GMT ) and three o'clock , " Palestinian lawmaker Ahmed Hashem <OOV> told Reuters . 

" This is a war that has been declared on us and we want our people to come and see the site where they declared the war . " 

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's government , which took office in June , has said it will not allow the Authority , set up under a 0000 interim peace deal to control parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank , to operate in Jerusalem . 

Israel 's previous government held the same position but in general turned a blind eye to Palestinian Authority activity in the city . 

Tuesday 's demolition came a day after PLO officials said they had bowed to Netanyahu 's demand they close offices in Jerusalem . 

They said two of the three offices Israel wanted closed had been shut . 

Netanyahu has made closure of the three offices a condition for resuming peace negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) . 

Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 0000 Middle East war and annexed it . 

It says it will never cede any part of the city . 

Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state . 

The city is up for negotiation at final peace talks which have yet to resume under Netanyahu . 

SEC adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices . 

WASHINGTON 0000-00-00 

The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders . 

The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 0-0 vote . 

The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them . 

The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time . 

Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock . 

In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices . 

" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , " said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt . 

The SEC 's goal , he added , was to create " one system where one price could be available to everybody . " 

The director of the SEC 's division of market regulation , Richard Lindsey , said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about $ 0 million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules . 

In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests . 

It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market . 

It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to " hidden " quotes the benefit of the best available prices . 

Earlier this month , the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the National Association of Securities Dealers , agreed to spend $ 000 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices . 

The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed . 

The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the " price improvement " proposal again . 

The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous " bid " and " ask " quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 0 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq . 

The SEC 's limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq , where such orders have never been displayed . 

The president of the Nasdaq , Alfred Berkeley , was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules ' effects on the market , the second largest in the world .

ROME 0000-00-00 

The Italian cabinet on Wednesday granted a reprieve for media mogul Silvio Berlusconi 's Mediaset television empire with a decree extending the current legal framework for television stations until January 00 , 0000 . 

The decree plugs a legal void in which magistrates could have forced the former prime minister to take one of the three stations he controls off the air because of a court ruling that no single proprietor should be allowed to keep three channels . 

Passengers injured in train collision in Linz . 

LINZ , Austria 0000-00-00 

A passenger train collided with a locomotive at a main railway station in Linz on Wednesday and police said around 00 people were injured . 

Austrian television reported earlier that more than 00 had been hurt in the accident at the station in Linz , 000 km ( 000 miles ) west of Vienna . 

" One locomotive was stationary and the passenger train collided into the back of it , " a police spokesman in Linz told Reuters by telephone . 

The express passenger train travelling from Steyr , southeast of Linz , with around 00 people on board , hit the back of a service locomotive used to shunt wagons into sidings . 

The police spokesman said he was not sure whether any more passengers were still trapped in the wreckage . 

Doctors and medical staff from a hospital across the road from the station were at the scene of the accident within minutes and were able to treat the injured quickly , he added . 

Greater damage was averted as the driver of the passenger train had time to apply his emergency brakes before the collision occurred , a state railways spokesman told Austrian news agency APA . 

Saskatchewan Wheat Pool eyes hog market . 

WINNIPEG 0000-00-00 

Canada 's largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by 0000 with a view to expanding the company 's scope into pork production . 

" Saskatchewan is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork , " Saskatchewan Wheat Pool chief executive Don Loewen said in a company statement . 

SWP said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in 0000 . 

The end of Canada 's rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie . 

Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie . 

SWP said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units , and it may consider contracting programs between producers and <OOV> which would operate within the existing hog market framework . 

Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group has an export monopoly but some Saskatchewan farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs .

Boardman clocked four minutes 00.000 seconds to slice more than six seconds from the previous world mark of 0:00.000 set by Olympic champion Andrea Collinelli of Italy in Atlanta in July . 

Collinelli qualified in second place , also beating his old record in 0:00.000 . 

" I was very nervous before the start but then I was amazed by the speed of my ride , " Boardman said . " 

I do n't know if I can go any faster . 

Who knows what will happen in the later stages ? " 

Boardman , 00 , did not contest the Olympic pursuit because of its proximity to the Tour de France in which he led the French GAN team . 

However , he took a bronze medal in the Olympic road time-trial and then returned home to prepare for the world track series in the Manchester indoor velodrome . 

He adopted the " superman " riding position with arms at full stretch perfected by fellow Briton Graeme Obree , the 0000 world champion , and taken up in Atlanta by Collinelli . 

Obree was forced to pull out of his title defence because of a viral infection .

I 'm only 00 .

Rowing is an endurance sport . "

TENNIS - SELES <OOV> <OOV> TO U.S. OPEN THIRD ROUND . 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Second seed and co-world number one Monica Seles advanced to the third round of the U.S. Open Tennis Championships without hitting a ball on Wednesday . 

Seles , the 0000 and 0000 champion who dropped just one game in her opening match , was scheduled to play Laurence Courtois of Belgium Wednesay night . 

But tournament officials announced about <OOV> hours before the match that Courtois had pulled out due to a left knee bone inflammation , moving Seles into the next round on a walkover . 

TENNIS - <OOV> <OOV> IS <OOV> FUN AGAIN . 

Richard Finn 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Outspoken Andrei Medvedev exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on Wednesday for a new no-nonsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again . 

" I think I 'm much more focused on what I have to do , and that 's playing tennis , " Medvedev said after routing Frenchman Jean-Philippe Fleurian 0-0 0-0 0-0 in the opening round of the U.S. Open . 

It was Medvedev 's sixth victory in a row after winning his first tournament of the year last week at the Hamlet Cup . 

" I realised this year , that without putting 00.0 percent of your mind into tennis , I do n't think you can successful , " said the 00-year-old Medvedev . 

" The whole day I 'm thinking <OOV> tennis . 

I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before , they were distracting me , they were not helping me at all . " 

For Medvedev that meant confining his post-match comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge , an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand . 

" I know what I 'm here for , " said Medvedev , who lost in the second round of the Open the last two years after reaching the quarters in 0000 , the same year he tried his hand as a restaurant critic . 

" I 'm not here to fight the press or talk about the food or entertain the people off the court . 

I 'm here to play tennis and to win . 

I have much less fun off the court . 

I have much more fun on the court , " he said . 

Just three years ago Medvedev was one of the world 's best , with a ranking of six after reaching the French Open semifinal and winning three tournaments . 

But Medvedev 's ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury . 

The Ukrainian finally hit a low of 00th two months ago . 

" It 's somewhere where I would n't like to stay very long , " Medvedev said of his current ranking of 00 . " 

It 's a part of the penalty that I have to accept . " 

As part of his new businesslike approach , Medvedev hired Australian coach Bob Brett at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off . 

" At the beginning of the year we started from zero , " said Medvedev . " 

Winning in Long Island ( last week ) was like winning for the first time . " 

While Medvedev 's <OOV> romp past Fleurian was rather ordinary , the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable . 

In the original draw , Medvedev and Fleurian were slotted to play each other . 

When controversy forced the draw to be done over -- against odds of <OOV> -- Medvedev and Fleurian drew each other a second time . 

" When I saw the new draw I did n't have to change my preparation , " Medvedev said . " 

I think it 's destined that it turned out for me . "

TENNIS - GRAF WORKS <OOV> FOR <OOV> WIN . 

Bill <OOV> 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

It was n't supposed to be this hard for defending champion Steffi Graf to win her opening match at the U.S. Open on Tuesday night . 

But the script that called for the usual first-round demolition by the top-ranked top seed was rewritten by 00th-ranked Indonesian Yayuk Basuki playing with nothing to lose abandon . 

Graf , of course , prevailed 0-0 0-0 , but not before some tense moments that even had the German superstar thinking the match was going three sets . 

" I won the second set , which I did n't think I would do , being down 0-0 and the chances she had at 0-0 , " Graf recalled . 

Several of the other women 's seeds eased into the second round with more typical <OOV> efficiency Tuesday . 

As afternoon turned to evening , fourth-seeded Spaniard Conchita Martinez took apart Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir in 00 minutes with the loss of just two games , one more than second seed Monica Seles , who opened the second-day programme by crushing American Anne Miller 0-0 0-0 . 

Third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the 0000 champion , and eighth-seeded Olympic gold medalist Lindsay Davenport dropped three game each en route to the second round . 

But the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women 's side . 

Fifth-seed Iva Majoli of Croatia was picked off by Austrian Judith Wiesner and Wimbledon semifinalist Kimiko Date of Japan , the 00th seed , fell 0-0 0-0 to <OOV> American Kimberly Po . 

Date 's defeat left no other seeded players in Seles 's quarter of the draw , which lost Anke Huber ( 0 ) and Maggie Maleeva ( 00 ) on Monday . 

But Graf , winner of 00 Grand Slam titles , was not about to join that list . 

" At some points I felt a little nervous , " she admitted . " 

When it came down to the important points , I felt more confident . " 

Basuki , a first-round loser here for the fifth consecutive year , was clearly going for winners , hitting the lines and running Graf around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking 0-0 lead . 

Graf ran off the next three games to restore some semblance of order . 

But Basuki , her long black ponytail flying as she raced for shots , held her serve and twice had set point on Graf 's serve at 0-0 before the German unleashed a forehand pass to force the tie-break . 

" I lost the moment , " lamented Basuki , who has reached the fourth round at Wimbledon four times and was a semifinalist in Montreal earlier this month . 

Still , the feisty Indonesian got off to a 0-0 lead in the tie-breaker before a pair of costly double faults gave Graf her chance to avoid a third set . 

" Usually in the first one or two matches , you want to find your rhythm and want to get into it , " said Graf , who won seven of the last eight points in the breaker . 

" To be in that situation today , a couple of times having to play well , get down and play point-by-point , definitely is a good start . " 

BASEBALL - <OOV> <OOV> <OOV> , OUT UP TO SIX <OOV> . 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

Chicago Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa underwent surgery on Monday to remove a fractured bone from his right hand and will miss four to six weeks , the club announced Tuesday . 

Sosa , a leading candidate for National League Most Valuable Player honours , was injured August 00th when he was hit by a Mark Hutton pitch in the first inning of an 0-0 victory over the Florida Marlins . 

The 00-year-old Sosa leads the league with 00 homers and is tied for 00th with 000 RBI . 

The loss of Sosa , who appeared in all 000 games this season , is a huge blow to the Cubs ' playoff hopes . 

SOCCER - <OOV> <OOV> KEEPS PSV AT TOP OF DUTCH LEAGUE . 

AMSTERDAM 0000-00-00 

Brazilian striker Marcelo scored a hat-trick as PSV Eindhoven maintained their 000 percent record and stayed on top of the Dutch first division with a 0-0 win at Volendam on Wednesday . 

PSV 's main rivals for the title , defending champions Ajax Amsterdam , celebrated the novelty of having the roof of their new 00,000 seat stadium closed against the rain , with a 0-0 win over AZ Alkmaar . 

Ajax were missing six first-team players but Frank de Boer shot home the winner from a <OOV> free kick in the 00th minute of a dull game . 

Marcelo , signed in close season to replace compatriot Ronaldo who left to play for Barcelona , opened the PSV scoring in the 00th minute when he fired home after good work from Rene Eijkelkamp . 

The Brazilian found the mark again two minutes after halftime and again in the 00th minute before midfielder Pascal <OOV> scored a consolation goal for Volendam five minutes from time . 

Feyenoord Rotterdam suffered an early shock when they went 0-0 down after four minutes against de Graafschap Doetinchem . 

The equaliser came in the 00rd minute when Swedish international Henke Larsson scored from close range and 00 minutes later Jean-Paul van Gastel gave Feyenoord a 0-0 victory from the penalty spot . 

After three matches PSV lead the first division with nine points , three points clear of fifth-placed Ajax . 

SOCCER - <OOV> WINS FIRST TROPHY WITH BARCELONA . 

MADRID 0000-00-00 

Former England manager Bobby Robson enjoyed his first success in charge of Barcelona as his team weathered 00 minutes of non-stop Atletico Madrid pressure to win the Spanish Super Cup 0-0 on aggregate on Wednesday . 

Barcelona had won the first leg 0-0 but the second leg was a different story . 

Atletico came within a whisker of taking the Cup on the away-goal rule but squandered several chances after going 0-0 ahead 00 minutes from the end . 

Juan Lopez gave Atletico the lead midway through the first half after Barcelona fullback Albert Ferrer and substitute goalkeeper Julen Lopetegui failed to clear a Milinko Pantic cross . 

Barcelona 's Hristo Stoichkov made his only significant contribution of the evening 00 minutes after halftime when Sergi Barjuan broke down the right to set up the fiery Bulgarian with a simple equaliser . 

But Atletico struck back almost immediately through new signing Juan Eduardo Esnaider and then Serbian set-piece specialist Pantic made it 0-0 with a superb free-kick in the 00th minute . 

Robson praised Atletico after the game , which was played in the Community of Madrid athletic stadium because of pitch problems at the Vicente Calderon ground . 

The venue of Atletico 's first league game , scheduled for Sunday , is still in doubt with the Real Madrid 's Santiago Bernabeu a distinct possibility .

The 00-year-old Gabrich , who signed for an undisclosed fee from the Argentine side Newell Old Boys , is set to join Dutch international Patrick Kluivert in the Ajax forward line . 

He is Ajax 's sixth new signing this year , joining midfielder Richard Witschge , defenders John Veldman and Mariano Juan and strikers Tijjani Babangida and Dani . 

SOCCER - PARMA , ROMA AND <OOV> OUT OF ITALIAN CUP . 

ROME 0000-00-00 

UEFA Cup hopefuls Parma and Roma , under new coaches this season , crashed out of the Italian Cup to second division opponents on Wednesday while league champions Milan could only draw 0-0 at humble Empoli . 

Wealthy Parma , now coached by the former Italian international Carlo Ancelotti , were without new striker Enrico Chiesa and went down 0-0 at serie B club Pescara in their second round clash . 

Pescara 's Ottavio <OOV> shattered Parma with goals in the second and fourth minutes . 

Midfielder Marco Giampaolo made it 0-0 in the 00th minute and Parma 's Alessandro Melli pulled back a late goal six minutes from time . 

The second round was the entry point for the bulk of the serie A sides with the winners going through . 

The later stages of the cup are played over two legs . 

Parma 's defeat was a repeat of last season 's fiasco when they lost their opening cup match 0-0 to Palermo . 

Roma , now coached by Argentine Carlos Bianchi and watched by Italian national coach Arrigo Sacchi , lost 0-0 to Cesena -- another repeat of last season when the Rome club also went out at the first hurdle . 

Udinese , with Germany 's Euro ' 00 hero Oliver Bierhoff in their lineup , completed the hat-trick of beaten serie A sides when they went under 0-0 to newly relegated Cremonese . 

Milan 's new Uruguayan coach Oscar Tabarez avoided the nightmare of defeat but faces a replay at home next Sunday . 

Cup holders Fiorentina easily beat Cosenza 0-0 while European Cup holders Juventus also cruised through with a 0-0 win at small southern club Fidelis <OOV> . 

Two other serie A sides lost at the weekend -- Piacenza and last year 's losing finalists Atalanta . 

Two cup matches could not be played on Wednesday due to argument over first round results . 

Lecce 's 0-0 weekend defeat of Genoa was expected to be overturned by a sporting judge on Thursday after the home club fielded an ineligible player . 

That would set Genoa up for a second round match against local rivals Sampdoria . 

Nocerina 's 0-0 defeat of Piacenza was also subject to a complaint , later removed , that forced their second round match against serie A newcomers Perugia to be delayed . 

SOCCER - <OOV> HIT <OOV> TO TAKE <OOV> TOP SPOT . 

BONN 0000-00-00 

Goals from Thomas Helmer and Juergen Klinsmann helped Bayern Munich to a 0-0 home win over Bayer Leverkusen on Wednesday and powered them to the top of the Bundesliga . 

The comfortable victory gave Bayern 00 points from their first four games , a point ahead of second-placed Stuttgart , who have a game in hand . 

Brazilian midfielder Paulo Sergio put Leverkusen ahead in the 00th minute but Alexander Zickler equalised just a minute later . 

A header from Helmer and an acrobatic strike from Klinsmann gave Bayern a two-goal cushion at halftime . 

But the pick of the <OOV> champions ' goals came from Ruggiero Rizzitelli , who beat three defenders to put Bayern 0-0 up . 

Markus Feldhoff hit a consolation goal for Leverkusen . 

Hansa Rostock brought Cologne 's 000 percent record to an end with a 0-0 win over the <OOV> club while a Sean Dundee hat-trick inside seven minutes stood out in Karlsruhe 's 0-0 demolition of St Pauli .

SOCCER - <OOV> 'S <OOV> GOAL KEEPS LENS IN THE LEAD . 

PARIS 0000-00-00 

Euro 00 star Vladimir Smicer of the Czech Republic scored at the last second for Lens , allowing them to retain the lead in the French soccer league on Wednesday . 

Smicer pushed the ball home in injury time to lead his team to a 0-0 victory over Montpellier , who were leading 0-0 until Cameroon 's Marc-Vivien Foe equalised on a header in the 00th minute . 

The win was the fourth in as many matches this season for Lens , who lead the table on 00 points . 

In-form Paris St Germain , who dismissed Nantes 0-0 , are second with 00 points . 

Along with Smicer , Robert Pires was the star of the night in France , scoring the first hat-trick of the league season in Metz 's 0-0 home victory over neighbouring Strasbourg . 

Pires , one of the most promising strikers in the country , was called up for the first time this week by French manager Aime Jacquet for a friendly against Mexico on Saturday at the Parc des Princes . 

Pires scored first with a powerful shot in the 00th minute before striking again from close range just before the break . 

A solitary raid allowed him to score his third in the 00th . 

Smicer 's goal was as hard-won as his team 's victory . 

Spurred by Foe 's leveller five minutes before , Lens pressed hard and Foe hit the crossbar in the dying seconds on another header . 

The ball bounced back to Smicer 's feet and he scored . 

Montpellier seized an unexpected lead thanks to Kader Ferhaoui in the fourth minute after a blunder from Lens goalkeeper Jean-Claude <OOV> . 

The side from northern France , forced to fight an uphill battle from then on , pulled level thanks to Tony Vairelles in the eighth minute but young striker Fabien Lefevre made it two for Montpellier five minutes later . 

League favourites PSG scored a convincing 0-0 win over Nantes and confirmed they would again be the team to beat this season . 

Ironically , PSG 's victory owed a lot to two former Nantes players , striker Patrice Loko , who scored on a brilliant shot in the 00rd minute , and defender Benoit Cauet , who started the one-two which allowed Loko to score . 

The Parisians , who have yet to concede a goal , were without Brazil 's Leonardo and Panama 's Julio Cesar Dely Valdes , both called up by their national sides . 

For Nantes , who shocked PSG to win the league crown two years ago , the fall is very painful . 

The Canaries , who lost most of their key players within two years , have yet to win a match this season . 

Reigning champions Auxerre had to settle for a goalless draw against Marseille on Tuesday .

ATHLETICS - <OOV> AND JOHNSON <OOV> TO <OOV> <OOV> ' <OOV> .

BONN 0000-00-00 

Organisers hope to persuade Britain 's former Olympic 000 metres champion Linford Christie to join a " Dream Team " sprint relay in a special tribute to Jesse Owens at Friday 's Berlin grand prix . 

Christie , who is retiring from international competition at the end of the season , was not due to compete in the German capital but Berlin promoter Rudi Thiel said : " We are still hopeful of getting him to come . " 

Thiel has managed to get most of the Olympic 000 metres champions since 0000 to attend the meeting , which is being held in the stadium where Owens won four gold medals 00 years ago at the Berlin Olympics . 

Canada 's Donovan Bailey , the Olympic 000 metres champion and world record holder , and Namibian Frankie Fredericks , the silver medallist at the recent Atlanta Games , have already agreed to run in the <OOV> metres team . 

Thiel said on Wednesday that he had also asked Olympic 000 and 000 champion Michael Johnson to run as well as Christie . 

" Most of the Olympic champions of the past are coming including Britain 's ( 0000 champion ) Allan Wells . 

Christie belongs to them . 

It would be great to have him here . 

" There is a good offer .... 

My minimum would be that he just ran the relay , " he said . 

The 00-year-old Briton is still considering the offer and is expected to announce his decision later on Wednesday . 

Owens 's widow Ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out during the meeting and one of the sprinter 's relatives is expected to attend . 

The relay race , which will include squads from Africa , the United States and Europe as well as the Owens ' quartet , will be held at the end of the meeting . 

Organisers had hoped to include 0000 and 0000 champion Carl Lewis in the squad but he injured himself in Brussels last Friday .

COLOMBO 0000-00-00 

Sachin Tendulkar marked his debut as Indian captain with a patient 000 on Wednesday , but was upstaged by dashing Sri Lankan opener Sanath Jayasuriya whose 000 steered the world champions to a nine-wicket Singer Cup win . 

Sri Lanka , playing in front of their home crowd for the first time since winning the World Cup last March , comfortably passed India 's modest 000-0 from 00 overs in 00.0 overs . 

The devastating opening pair of Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana shared a fine first wicket stand of 000 to the delight of the 00,000 fans . 

Jayasuriya , whose first 00 included three sixes and three fours , went on to an unbeaten 000 and the man-of-the-match award . 

Kaluwitharana , slow in comparison , was bowled by Tendulkar for 00 , but Aravinda de Silva with 00 not out helped see Sri Lanka home . 

Earlier , Tendulkar completed his ninth century in one-day cricket , taking 000 balls to do it before being run out . 

The rest of the Indian batting was generally tied down by brilliant fielding and some fairly tight bowling , although <OOV> Mohamed Azharuddin chipped in with 00 , adding 000 with Tendulkar off 00 overs , before being stumped . 

The next match in the four-nation tournament is on Friday when Sri Lanka play Australia in a repeat of the World Cup final in Lahore where Sri Lanka won by seven wickets .

PRESS DIGEST - ANGOLA - AUG 00 . 

LUANDA 0000-00-00 

These are the leading stories in the Angolan press on Wednesday . 

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy . 

<OOV> DE ANGOLA 

- Princeton Lyman , the U.S. Under-Secretary of State for International Organisations , will on Wednesday continue his work in Angola visiting Bailundo , where he should be received by Jonas Savimbi , leader of Unita . 

On Tuesday Lyman participated in a meeting of a <OOV> where he considered that the Angolan politicians should advance faster and find a way to cooperate . 

In his opinion the quartering of Unita forces must be concluded in all the Angolan territory and the troops must be selected and integrated in the armed forces , the government forces must be concentrated in the principal units and the free circulation of people and goods must be reality in all the country . 

<OOV> <OOV> <OOV> TO <OOV> <OOV> POLICE . 

CAPE TOWN 0000-00-00 

South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said on Wednesday it would subpoena persons accused of human rights violations to appear before it . 

" We can subpoena anyone we want to , even the president of the country , " spokesman John Allen told Reuters . " 

<OOV> are due to be served on a number of people this week . " 

Media reports have speculated that the commission , which is trying to heal the wounds of apartheid by confronting the past , could subpoena apartheid-era President P.W. Botha and former police generals Basie Smit and Johan Van Der Merwe . 

In submissions last week to the commission National Party leader and former president F.W. De Klerk said he had received no co-operation from Botha in compiling his party 's report . 

Since it began work in April the commission has been hearing harrowing tales from the victims of apartheid-era abuses , by both the white minority regime and its opponents . 

It also wants to hear from those who committed the abuses , to whom it can offer amnesty in return for frankness . 

Hopes that reformed perpetrators would come forward voluntarily have faded but the commission has the legal power to force them to appear . 

Allen declined to give say who would be subpoenaed . 

" At the moment we have a preliminary list of less than 00 people , but this is just the beginning , " he said . 

The commission was set up last year to probe 00 years of human-rights violations during the apartheid era . 

It is chaired by Nobel Peace winner , retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu . 

Allen said the commission could announce the names of subpoenaed persons on Monday next week .

" The plane landed at Sofia airport at 0000 ( 0000 GMT ) after receiving a signal that there is an explosive on board , " the official , who declined to be named told Reuters . 

The plane , surrounded by 00 fire-engines , is being checked for explosives at the moment . 

Nothing has been found so far , added the official . 

In March a Turkish Cypriot airliner hijacked while on a flight from northern Cyprus to Istanbul landed in Sofia airport to refuel before landing in Munich , where the hijacker was arrested . 

Arch Alberta well tests 0,000 <OOV> / day . 

FORT WORTH , Texas 0000-00-00 

Arch Petroleum Inc said Wednesday an exploratory well in Alberta 's Morinville area tested in excess of 0,000 barrels daily and will begin production immediately . 

The company said the 00 percent owned Trax et al Morinville 00-00 logged 00 feet of productive Leduc Reef at 0,000 feet . 

Reserve estimates from this well are at 000,000 gross barrels of oil . 

The Trax well is one of the prospects developed by Arch through its early 0000 purchase of Trax <OOV> Ltd , the company said . 

It said another , the <OOV> et al Morinville 00-00 , has logged 000 feet of productive Leduc Reef at 0,000 feet and is flowing water free at the rate of 000 barrels of oil per day on a 00 / <OOV> choke . 

Arch owns a 00 percent working interest in this well with most of the rest held by the privately owned operator . 

Arch said full production has begun and initial estimates of gross reserves attributable to this well range up to one million barrels of oil . 

A third well drilled in this area , the Trax et al Morinville 0-00 , encountered the Leduc Reef but tested wet . 

At the company 's <OOV> prospect , the Apache et al Saunders 00-00 , has reached total depth in the Leduc Reef at approximately 0,000 feet and has been abandoned , Arch said . 

It said this acreage earning well brought an interest in an additional 0,000 acres , building the company 's gross land position in this area to 0,000 acres . 

At the Butte prospect , the <OOV> 0-0 has reached total depth of 00,000 and has logged 000 feet of Leduc Reef . 

Testing has begun and results will be announced within the next several days , Arch said . 

Including the costs of the two abandoned wells , the company said , these first prospects have added to reserves at a finding cost of about U.S. $ 0 per barrel of oil equivalent .

U.S. judge orders Biogen , Berlex officials deposed . 

Leslie <OOV> 

BOSTON 0000-00-00 

In order to help him decide whether he should hear the case , a U.S. District Court judge Wednesday ordered the legal counsels of Biogen Inc and Berlex Laboratories , a subsidiary of Schering AG , deposed . 

The tempest beyond the test tube involves allegations that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration violated the <OOV> Drug law by allowing Biogen the right to sell its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex . 

Berlex also charges that Avonex is so similar to its MS drug , Betaseron , that it is a patent infringement . 

Both drugs are types of interferon . 

One analyst said sales of Avonex had already cut into Betaseron market share . 

<OOV> Research , Inc 's analyst Eddie <OOV> said , " Berlex sales are losing share like mad ... 

my understanding of the marketplace is that they 're below expectations . " 

He added Chiron Corp reported its sales of inventory to Berlex was down . 

Chiron makes Betaseron ; Berlex markets it , he said . 

Biogen , in its Securities and Exchange Commission quarterly report for the period ending June 00 , said it had earned $ 0.0 million from Avonex sales during the drugs first six weeks on the market . 

When it approved Avonex in May , the FDA said both Biogen 's product and Betaseron were developed under the incentives of the <OOV> Drug Act which provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for products that treat rare diseases . 

Avonex " has been allowed to enter the market because it differs from interferon <OOV> ( Betaseron ) .. 

. " 

the FDA said . 

Now , U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf has ordered the chief counsel for Biogen , Michael <OOV> , and Robert <OOV> , his counterpart at Berlex be deposed about a May 00 meeting the two men attended to help him determine whether the lawsuit filed by Biogen against Berlex should be heard in Massachusetts . 

Berlex filed a lawsuit against Biogen in U.S. District Court in Newark , N.J. in July , but Biogen had already filed a suit against Berlex in Massachusetts in May . 

Wolf ordered the depositions to determine if he or U.S. District Judge John <OOV> of Newark should preside over the case .

COMEX copper ends higher after late recovery . 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

COMEX copper ended higher after a late , modest recovery dragged the market from the lows , but traders <OOV> an imminent strike at Codelco 's Salvador mine in Chile . 

The market was also waiting for Friday 's LME stock report which will include figures delayed from Tuesday because of the U.K. public holiday on Monday when the LME was closed . 

" We are in the late stages of the weaker period of the market , and as we get to the post Labor Day market we will start to see more consumer interest and the demand side of the market will start to firm prices up , " said William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch . 

December COMEX settled 0.00 cent higher at 00.00 cents , traded 00.00 to 00.00 cents . 

September went out 0.00 cent lower at 00.00 . 

The August contract expired at 0.00 cent down at 00.00 cents . 

Volume was estimated at 0,000 lots . 

Workers at Salvador voted to strike from Saturday , and it was not clear when further talks between the unions and management would take place . 

" Salvador is a small facility , and the prospects are that if there will be a strike , it will not be a long strike , " O'Neill said .

" After examining the dossier of the <OOV> Africa match , we decided ... 

to disqualify the national team of Burundi from the 00st African Cup of Nations ...

Canada <OOV> Chinese asylum-seekers - report . 

VANCOUVER , British Columbia 0000-00-00 

Canada is fast-tracking immigration applications from Chinese dissidents in Hong Kong before the British colony reverts to China 's control next year , the Vancouver Sun reported on Wednesday . 

The applications are being " fast-tracked in the sense that we are processing them and the ones who have been referred to us have been interviewed , " the newspaper quoted Garrett Lambert , Canada 's high commissioner in Hong Kong , as saying . 

" A small number already have preliminary indications as to what the disposition of their cases are and so I suppose in that sense , I guess we have given them some preferential treatment , " Lambert said . 

He declined to say how many people were being considered for asylum . 

Canada 's ministry of foreign affairs in Ottawa had no immediate comment on the report . 

About 00 Chinese dissidents are believed to be living in exile in Hong Kong . 

Their fate after the territory reverts to Chinese rule is unclear . 

Britain hands Hong Kong back to China at midnight on June 00 , 0000 , after 000 years of colonial rule . 

Canada 's Minister of Foreign Affairs Lloyd Axworthy said after meeting Hong Kong Gov . 

Chris Patten last month that Canada may grant asylum to dissidents who have fled to Hong Kong from China . 

Chinese officials have said such dissidents may not become Hong Kong permanent residents since they entered the territory illegally but have also said their status would be decided by the <OOV> local Hong Kong administration . 

Ivorian journalist held , asked to reveal source . 

ABIDJAN 0000-00-00 

An Ivorian journalist spent a third day in custody on Wednesday and investigators were demanding that he reveal the source of an official document published in his newspaper , colleagues said . 

Raphael <OOV> , publication director of Ivorian newspaper Le Populaire , was taken in for questioning on Monday over an article about the public prosecutor and has been detained since then . 

Colleagues said he had been charged with theft of administrative documents . " 

He is being asked for the source of his information and who gave him this confidential document , " one colleague told Reuters . 

Three journalists from the Ivorian opposition daily La Voie are serving two-year prison terms for insulting President Henri Konan Bedie . 

A court sentenced two in December and the third in January . 

La Voie published an article suggesting the presence of Bedie had brought local team ASEC bad luck during their defeat by Orlando Pirates of South Africa in the final of the African Champions Cup in December . 

The United States embassy in Abidjan and international press organisations denounced the sentences as excessive . 

Last year , Bedie pardoned four journalists jailed for the same or similar offences . 

They included one of the three La Voie journalists . 

Bedie pardoned two other journalists jailed for incitement to disturb public order . 

Village attack kills 00 in eastern Sierra Leone . 

FREETOWN 0000-00-00 

Sierra Leonean rebels killed 00 villagers and seven soldiers in an attack on the eastern village of <OOV> , Eastern Region Brigade Commander Major Fallah Sewa said on Wednesday . 

Sewa said the rebels overran <OOV> despite the presence of government troops in the village on the highway between Mano Junction and the diamond town of Tongo Field . 

An army spokesman in Freetown said Monday night 's attack was the third on a military post in the past week . 

Rebels of the Revolutionary United Front agreed a ceasefire in April . 

Continuing attacks are generally ascribed to renegade soldiers or uncontrolled bands of rebels and refugees displaced by the fighting starting to return to their homes . 

Peace talks in Ivory Coast began in February . 

Diplomats say they are deadlocked over the RUF 's insistence that foreign troops helping the government army should leave , and that they should have some say in the allocation of budget spending .

Zambia 's Chiluba shuffles cabinet to fill vacancy . 

LUSAKA 0000-00-00 

Zambian President Frederick Chiluba shuffled his cabinet on Wednesday to fill a vacancy left after the sacking of Legal Affairs Minister Remmy Mushota . 

Mushota was fired a month ago after a government tribunal found he tried to withdraw cash from state coffers without authority . 

The president 's office said in a statement that Lands Minister Luminzu Shimaponda had been appointed Legal Affairs Minister , while Deputy Foreign Minister Peter <OOV> would take over from Shimaponda . 

Guinea launches war on fictitious civil servants . 

CONAKRY 0000-00-00 

Guinea launched a drive on Wednesday to rid the civil service payroll of fictitious workers as part of new prime minister Sidia Toure 's campaign to cut government spending . 

Deputy Minister for Finance Ousmane Kaba said teams of inspectors would check government offices in the capital and the provinces to root out civil servants who drew salaries but had left their jobs , were dead , or had never existed . 

Some 00 million Guinean francs ( $ 00,000 ) has been pumped into the exercise to deter the inspectors from taking bribes . 

Kaba told reporters the annual wage bill of 000 billion Guinean francs represented 00 percent of current state expenditure , " whereas the acceptable proportion in countries similar to ours is one third " . 

Toure , who took office last month , has said he plans to cut public service spending by 00 percent by the end of the year as part of measures to revive the economy . 

Guinea is rich in minerals and has a vast potential for hydroelectric power generation but it faces stiff competition from its West African neighbours for foreign investment . 

President Lansana Conte appointed Toure , a former senior civil servant in Ivory Coast , last month to clean up the administration and reform the economy following February 's bloody army revolt .

New Liberia Council chief to be installed Tuesday . 

MONROVIA 0000-00-00 

Ruth Perry , the woman with the task of uniting Liberia 's squabbling factions around the latest peace plan , will be formally installed as head of the ruling State Council next Tuesday , a Council statement said . 

Perry , a Liberian Senate member during the 0000s , returned to Monrovia on August 00 after West African leaders nominated her for the job under a peace deal signed in Nigeria 's capital Abuja five days earlier . 

The formal inauguration had been due to take place this week but was put back . 

There was no official explanation but politicians said faction leaders and State Council vice-chairmen Charles Taylor and <OOV> Kromah were unable to attend because they were travelling . 

Liberia 's civil war , launched by Taylor in 0000 , has killed well over 000,000 people . 

Faction fighting and an orgy of looting in the capital Monrovia in April and May killed hundreds of people . 

Over a dozen peace deals have collapsed . 

The latest sets a timetable for disarmament by the end of January and elections by May 00 . 

West African leaders have threatened individual sanctions against faction leaders to ensure compliance . 

Freed American slaves founded Liberia in 0000 . 

Nigeria rights group says four academics arrested . 

LAGOS 0000-00-00 

A Nigerian human rights group said on Wednesday that four members of a recently banned university union had been arrested . 

" The Constitutional Rights Project ( CRP ) believes that William <OOV> , Elisha <OOV> , O.K. <OOV> and Jerome <OOV> were arrested because of their role in the ongoing ASUU ( Academic Staff Union of Universities ) strike , " the group said in a statement . 

The CRP said the four were arrested on Monday night at the northeastern Tafawa Balewa University . 

The main academic union , ASUU , along with two smaller university unions , was banned by Nigeria 's military government last week , because of a four-month strike by teachers for better working conditions . 

Nigeria is under fire from many Western countries for human rights abuses and lack of democracy . 

Dozens of people opposed to the government are in detention . 

Commonwealth foreign ministers are to meet in London on Wednesday to discuss what action to take , after a visit to Nigeria was called off when the government imposed strict rules on whom the mission would be allowed to see . 

Nigeria was suspended from the club of Britain and its former colonies in November after the hanging of nine minority rights activists for murder in spite of international pleas for clemency . 

Dutroux suspected in murder of Slovak woman . 

Peter <OOV> 

BRATISLAVA 0000-00-00 

Marc Dutroux , the chief accused in a Belgian child murder and sex abuse scandal , is suspected of murdering a young Slovak woman , the Slovak office of Interpol said on Wednesday . 

Rudolf Gajdos , head of Slovak Interpol , told a news conference Dutroux was also believed to have planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman . 

" One of the police versions in the case of the murder of young gypsy woman in Topolcany , western Slovakia , this July , is a suspicion that Mark Dutroux could have been involved in the murder , " Gajdos said without elaborating on the age of the victim and on the other versions . 

Slovak police , Interpol , and Belgian police have been following leads on Dutroux 's activities in Slovakia and the neighbouring Czech Republic where he is known to have made frequent visits . 

Gajdos said the police sketch of the suspected murderer was " 00 percent identical with Dutroux 's portrait " , and that Dutroux was known to have been in Topolcany around the time of the woman 's murder . 

" Topolcany and the area around this town were reported to have been the most visited places by Dutroux and his accomplices in Slovakia , " Gajdos said . 

Dutroux , a convicted child rapist and unemployed father-of-three , led police 00 days ago to the bodies of eight-year-olds Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo in the garden of another of the six houses he owns around the southern Belgian city of Charleroi . 

" The Belgian police also informed us that Dutroux , together with one other man , had ( also ) planned the kidnapping of at least one Slovak woman , " Gajdos said . 

" The plan apparently failed due to difficulties in crossing the border , " he added , but did not elaborate . 

The Slovak police are also investigating visits by about 00 Slovak women , aged 00 to 00 , to Belgium , at the invitation of Dutroux . 

The women said they went to Belgium voluntarily and police suspect they were used to act in pornographic films , Gajdos said earlier this week . 

But he added they had difficulty remembering what happened during their visits to Belgium , perhaps because of drugs , and were unsure whether they were filmed for pornography . 

Dutroux , 00 , who was charged last week with the abduction and illegal imprisonment of two girls aged 00 and 00 , is also suspected in the disappearance of Belgians An Marchal , 00 , and Eefje Lambrecks , 00 , who went missing a year ago . 

<OOV> kills Polish beauty queen , wounds husband . 

WARSAW 0000-00-00 

A man knifed to death international model Agnieszka Kotlarska outside her home in Wroclaw , western Poland , Polish television said on Wednesday . 

The man , who said he had once been engaged to her , first knifed Kotlarska 's husband in the leg , then stabbed her three times in the chest when she tried to intervene during the incident on Tuesday . 

She died in hospital . 

Kotlarska , who was 00 and had a three-year-old child , was Miss Poland in 0000 and went on to a <OOV> modelling career that included working with Italian designer Gianni Versace and Vogue magazine , the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper said . 

She had been due to fly on a TWA airliner which exploded near New York last month , but had cancelled her booking , the newspaper said . 

Her attacker , identified only as Jerzy L. , 00 , was arrested by police and will appear in court on Thursday morning , television reported . 

It said he had admitted the attack but had denied intending to kill Kotlarska . 

Russian shares slip in thin volume . 

MOSCOW 0000-00-00 

Leading Russian shares edged down on Wednesday in thin volume in the absence of Western orders , traders said . 

The Russian Trading System index of 00 issues fell 0.00 percent to 000.00 on volume of $ 0.00 million . 

" The market was extremely quiet today , some profit-taking locally , no Western orders , " said Nick Mokhoff , director of sales and trade at <OOV> . " 

We are just a bit lower with a lot of inactivity during the whole day . " 

Alexander <OOV> , managing director at <OOV> Securities , said the volume of orders was four to five times lower than a week ago . 

As often , the most volume was in UES . 

" Unified is one of the blue chips , which has more prospects than anybody else does , because they have ADRs supposedly coming up , " Mokhoff said . 

UES officials said last week the board had not yet approved the final version of its application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue ADRs . 

UES fell to $ 0.0000 from $ 0.0000 at Tuesday 's close with 0.00 million shares changing hands . 

Gazprom was the loser of the day with prices closing at $ 0.000 , down from $ 0.000 on Tuesday and $ 0.000 on Monday . 

Mokhoff said uncertainty about when Gazprom would issue ADRs and about whether shares from the Russian market could be converted into ADRs had hurt prices . 

" Western investors ... will be investing in ADRs and I do not think people in Russia will be able to come up with the money for the underlying shares to drive the Russian shares to those levels , " Mokhoff said . 

Gazprom has also tightened the rules restricting <OOV> ' rights to trade its shares . 

Mosenergo closed at at $ 0.000 after $ 0.000 , Rostelekom fell to $ 0.00 from $ 0.00 and LUKoil was $ 0.00 after $ 0.00 .

Albania asks Greece to explain deportations . 

TIRANA 0000-00-00 

Albania asked Greece on Wednesday to explain why it was deporting more Albanian immigrants , Foreign Minister Tritan Shehu said . 

The Albanian daily Koha Jone reported earlier that Greece had deported about 0,000 Albanians in the last five days . 

" The Foreign Ministry is trying to find out from the Greek embassy why Albanian refugees have been deported from Greece , " Shehu told Reuters . 

Athens and Tirana signed an accord in May to legalise the status of Albanian immigrant workers , estimated at 000,000 , and remove a long-standing stumbling block in relations between the two Balkan neighbours . 

Bulgarians recover 00 pct of confiscated land . 

SOFIA 0000-00-00 

Bulgaria has restored ownership rights to pre-communist private owners of 00 percent of the arable land or around four million hectares , an Agriculture Ministry official said on Wednesday . 

" So far 00 percent has been returned with the land restitution almost completed in some regions like Southeastern Bulgaria but lagging behind in other areas , predominantly in the mountains , " the official told a news conference . 

The ministry has said that it planned to return 00.0 percent of the arable land or 0.0 million hectares to its original owners by the end of this year . 

A land reform act passed four years ago abolished Soviet-style collective farms , allowing the return of 0.0 million hectares to original owners or their heirs .

German chancellor to meet Yeltsin Sept 0 - Interfax . 

MOSCOW 0000-00-00 

German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who spoke to President Boris Yeltsin by telephone on Wednesday , plans a trip to Moscow on September 0 and will visit Yeltsin at his vacation home near Moscow , Interfax news agency said . 

Interfax , quoting Yeltsin press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky , said Yeltsin and Kohl had discussed bilateral relations and international issues on the telephone . 

Yeltsin had told Kohl about efforts to find a political solution to the conflict in Russia 's breakaway Chechnya region , Interfax added . 

Yeltsin , who left on vacation on Monday , is staying at an exclusive private hunting lodge some 000 km ( 00 miles ) from Moscow . 

Germany has been one of the loudest critics of Russia 's military intervention in Chechnya , a 00-month-old conflict in which tens of thousands of people have been killed . 

Exiled Bosnians protest confusing voting rules . 

Duncan Shiels 

<OOV> , Hungary 0000-00-00 

Bosnian refugees in Hungary , the first to vote last weekend in their country 's first post-war election , found the rules confusing and some had no idea who they voted for , refugees and officials said on Wednesday . 

" For the most part they really did n't understand what was going on , " the director of the Nagyatad camp Lajos Horvath told Reuters on Wednesday . 

" It was confusing , they had no experience of voting , many of the refugees are only semi-literate and none of them knew anything about the candidates , " he said . 

" They just voted along ethnic lines where they could . " 

The Bosnian election is set for September 00 and voting began on Wednesday for most of the 000,000 Bosnians living abroad . 

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which is running the election , allowed the ballot to be held on Sunday in four Hungarian refugee camps . 

Some Moslem refugees among the 000 registered voters Hungary 's largest camp Nagyatad have written to the OSCE complaining that they were unable to vote in contests for the president or assembly of the Bosnian-Croat Federation , where most Moslems live . 

This was because their pre-war homes are now in the Serb-controlled territory , so they were voting for the national assembly of the Republika <OOV> , most of the candidates for which are Serbs . 

For the foreign powers which back last year 's Dayton peace agreement , the main point of the election rules is that by voting as though they were still in their pre-war homes , Bosnians should override the effects of ethnic cleansing and reassert the concept of a single multi-ethnic state . 

But Adem Hodzic , one of the refugees who signed the letter of complaint , told Reuters : 

" We only realised after voting that we were being denied the rights of other Bosnian Moslems to choose our president . 

This vote seals the division of my country . " 

Under the election rules citizens vote for a three-man presidency and House of Representatives for all Bosnia-Hercegovina and for assemblies and cantonal seats in either the Moslem-Croat Federation or the Republika <OOV> . 

On Sunday voters in Hungary also cast ballots for municipal councils but these will be invalidated following the cancellation of local elections by the OSCE on Tuesday . 

Husein <OOV> , who also signed the letter , alleged that elderly voters were directed who to vote for by Hungarian translators who stood in the polling booth to help them . 

" Probably 000 refugees were shown where to put their cross , " he said . 

Seventy eight-year-old <OOV> Zelic , a Bosnian Croat who has spent the last five years in Nagyatad , told Reuters she had cast her ballot because she 'd been told to by the camp authorities but had no idea who she voted for . 

" At first the organisers would n't let anyone help me but when they saw I did n't understand a young translator ringed the names I had to mark , " she said . " 

I do n't know who I voted for . " 

Maria Szabo of the Hungarian office organising the elections on behalf of the OSCE told Reuters on Wednesday her office was studying the letter but said they had followed OSCE instructions very carefully . 

" The envelopes , each with the five different voting slips , were sealed until voting and had written instructions on how to vote , " she said . " 

But of course those who could not read had to be shown . " 

Estonia presidential race next round on Sept 00 . 

TALLINN 0000-00-00 

Estonia will hold the next round of an inconclusive state presidential race on September 00 , parliamentary officers of the Baltic state ruled on Wednesday . 

This comes after three votes in the <OOV> parliament on Monday and Tuesday failed to give either incumbent Lennart Meri or rival candidate Arnold Ruutel the necessary 00 votes for a clear mandate . 

The outcome was a rebuff for Meri , failing three times to win backing in his bid for a second term as head of state of the former Soviet republic . 

Parliament 's press officer told Reuters that Speaker Toomas Savi will convene an electoral college involving 000 MPs and and 000 local government representatives on September 00 . 

Both Meri , 00 , and Ruutel , 00 will automatically be listed as candidates but the election will also be open to new nominations with the backing of any 00 members of the college . 

The winner has to secure a majority from the college within two rounds of voting otherwise the election will go back before the parliament . 

Lebed likely to fail on Chechnya - Polish minister . 

WARSAW 0000-00-00 

Russian security chief Aleksander Lebed faces an almost impossible task in Chechnya and is likely to be sidelined , Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati was reported as saying on Wednesday . 

According to best-selling daily Gazeta Wyborcza , Rosati told the Polish parliament 's foreign affairs committee on Tuesday that the fact Lebed had been charged with resolving the conflict in Chechnya showed he would be marginalised . 

" It is almost impossible to gain success in this , " it quoted Rosati as saying during a committee debate . 

" Lebed has no diplomatic experience . 

Yeltsin sent him there to compromise him . 

This tactical manoeuvre also shows that in the ruling circle there is no unity of action , " he said . 

Lebed , who has arranged a military truce with separatist rebels in the southern Russia region , was in Moscow this week seeking support for a deal on Chechnya 's political status . 

But Russian President Boris Yeltsin has seemed unwilling to meet his envoy and went on holiday on Monday . 

Gazeta Wyborcza quoted Rosati as saying Yeltsin was very ill and effectively on leave , but for now retained control in Russia although matters were passing into the hands of his close collaborators . 

Rosati said Russia 's July polls , in which Yeltsin won re-election , showed democracy had passed an important test and the Russian people had <OOV> the path of further reforms . 

But he said a power struggle in Russia 's ruling circles could not be ruled out , which could harm further reforms . 

He expressed concern over problems in the Russian economy , saying this could lead to social unrest , the daily reported . 

On Moscow 's foreign policy , Rosati said it had changed its stance on NATO 's eastward expansion and was preparing itself for Poland 's inevitable entry into the Western alliance . 

He also reportedly criticised Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov , saying his style of work resembled that of the Soviet-era 0000s and 0000s . 

Romania state budget soars in June . 

BUCHAREST 0000-00-00 

Romania 's state budget deficit jumped sharply in June to 0,000.0 billion lei for the January-June period from 000.0 billion lei in January-May , official data showed on Wednesday . 

Six-month expenditures stood at 0.00 trillion lei , up from 0.00 trillion lei at end-May , with education and health spending accounting for 00.0 percent of state expenses and economic subsidies and support taking some 00 percent . 

January-June revenues went up to 0.00 trillion lei from 0.00 trillion lei in the first five months this year . 

Romania 's government is expected to revise the 0000 budget on Wednesday to bring it into line with higher inflation , new wage and pension <OOV> and costs of energy imports that have pushed up the state deficit . 

Under the revised version state spending is expected to rise by some 000 billion lei . 

No new deficit forecast has been issued so far . 

In July the government gave a <OOV> wage and pension indexation to cover energy , fuel and bread price increases , which quickened inflation to 0.0 percent last month . 

In the original state budget , approved in March , revenues were envisaged at around 00.00 trillion lei and expenditures 00.00 trillion lei for 0000 . 

The state budget deficit was originally forecast to be 0.00 trillion lei for the whole year . 

On Wednesday , the leu 's official rate was 0,000 to the dollar .

Costa Rica says Dutch pair kidnapped by Nicaraguans . 

SAN JOSE , Costa Rica 0000-00-00 

The Costa Rican government said on Wednesday that a Dutch couple abducted over the weekend from a tree farm in northern Costa Rica was kidnapped by former Nicaraguan guerrillas . 

" Even though it 's an act of common delinquency , the case could take a difficult turn because former Nicaraguan guerrillas are involved , " Security Minister Bernardo Arce told reporters . 

Earlier this year , a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped from the same general area in northern Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan border . 

They were held for 00 days before relatives paid a ransom to free them . 

Two Nicaraguan former guerrillas have been arrested in the case . 

Because of the apparent threat to foreigners in Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan border , Arce said the government has advised many to take additional security measures on their own . 

<OOV> <OOV> Zylstra and his wife , <OOV> <OOV> Coers , both 00 years old , were seized late on Saturday or early on Sunday from a teak tree plantation they manage by at least two heavily armed men who took the two off in their own car , leaving behind a ransom note demanding $ 0.0 million . 

The plantation is owned by Dutch citizen <OOV> Huizinga , who has since arrived in Costa Rica to deal with the matter . 

Gov't dodging extradition , Colombian official says . 

BOGOTA , Colombia 0000-00-00 

A top judicial official and critic of President Ernesto Samper accused the government of indifference on Wednesday over efforts to lift Colombia 's five-year-old ban on extradition . 

" It would seem that the subject of extradition is unworthy of an opinion from the government , " Deputy Prosecutor-General Adolfo Salamanca said . 

Constitutional reforms were proposed on Tuesday by two senators , one of them a member of Samper 's own Liberal Party , aimed at lifting the ban on extradition introduced in 0000 . 

U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette applauded the move , saying it could prompt the Clinton administration to remove Colombia from a list of outcast nations that have failed to cooperate in U.S. counternarcotics efforts . 

Samper -- who weathered a year-old crisis stemming from charges he financed his 0000 election campaign with drug money -- appeared less than enthusiastic , however . 

" Extradition is not on the government 's legislative agenda , " he told reporters on Tuesday . 

He added that he did not oppose the idea of opening a public debate over the issue . 

But he fell far short of endorsing the idea of putting Colombian drug lords onto <OOV> flights to serve stiff penalities in American prisons . 

Salamanca , who spoke at a meeting on kidnapping in Colombia , has said in the past that there was ample evidence to prove that Samper 's campaign received millions of dollars in contributions from the country 's top drug lords .

PLO Council calls for halt to contacts with Israel . 

RAMALLAH , West Bank 0000-00-00 

The Palestinian Legislative Council on Wednesday called for a halt to contacts with Israel , just hours after President Yasser Arafat said the Jewish state had effectively declared war on the Palestinians by pursuing its hardline policies . 

A resolution released by the council called for " halting contacts with the Israeli side and leaving the mechanism to carry out this to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat " . 

The council was meeting in Ramallah to discuss Israel 's new policy of Jewish settlement expansion and its uncompromising line on Jerusalem since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June . 

Council resolutions are not necessarily binding . 

Arafat had earlier blasted Israel saying its policies amounted to a declaration of war against the Palestinian people . 

He also called for the first general strike in two years in the West Bank and Gaza on Thursday . 

" What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people , " Arafat told the council . 

Council speaker Ahmed Korei said the decision was part of a comprehensive plan to confront Israeli settlement policy , land confiscation and what he termed other violations of the Israeli-PLO peace deals .

" The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) leadership declares its endorsement for a ceasefire arrangement with the KDP ( Kurdistan Democratic Party ) to take effect as of 0:00 a.m. on August 00 , " the PUK said in a statement . 

The PUK said the ceasefire was agreed after talks between U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau and PUK leader Jalal Talabani . 

The KDP , led by Massoud Barzani , had said a previous ceasefire negotiated by Pelletreau last Friday was broken by the PUK . 

Talabani has agreed to take part in talks in London on reaching a comprehensive settlement for the PUK-KDP conflict , the PUK statement said . 

It said the KDP was responsible for breaking the previous ceasefire by refusing to endorse it publicly . 

Kurd group says Iraqi troops massing near north . 

ANKARA 0000-00-00 

An Iraqi Kurdish group on Wednesday said Iraq was massing troops near Kurdish regions in the north , where a U.S.-led allied air force protects the local population against attacks from Baghdad . 

" The Iraqi regime has started threatening the Kurdish population by massing troops in preparation to attack Kurdish towns and population centres , " the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan ( PUK ) said in a statement . 

The PUK said it had received confirmed reports that Iraqi troops , supported by tanks , artillery and armoured vehicles , have already penetrated some Kurdish areas . 

It said the military presence reflects cooperation between President Saddam Hussein and the PUK 's rival , the Kurdistan Democratic Party ( KDP ) . 

The PUK statement follows KDP assertions that the PUK is receiving military support from Iran . 

Hostilities between the two warring Iraqi Kurdish factions have continued in the last few days despite a <OOV> ceasefire last Friday . 

The PUK called on the United Nations and allied forces to halt the Iraqi aggression . 

U.S. , French and British aircraft have safeguarded the Iraqi Kurdish population against aggression from Baghdad since shortly after the Gulf War in 0000 . 

The allied force , known as Operation Provide Comfort , is based in southern Turkey . 

Iraq says hijackers were not diplomats . 

BAGHDAD 0000-00-00 

Iraq on Wednesday said the hijackers of a Sudanese airliner were not Iraqi diplomats and added that " noble Iraqis " would never contemplate such an action . 

The official Iraqi News Agency ( INA ) quoted Iraq 's ambassador in Khartoum as saying that Iraq 's embassy in the Sudanese capital had nothing to do with the Monday night hijacking . 

Iraq 's ambassador in Khartoum denounced the hijacking and described it as a terrorist act which had nothing to do " with the morals and values of noble Iraqis , " INA said . 

Ambassador <OOV> Hameed Ali told INA there was only one diplomat among the 000 passengers and crew on the Sudan Airways Airbus . 

" He was not involved ... 

on the contrary he was harassed by the elements which carried out the hijacking , " he said . 

INA did not say the hijackers were Iraqis . 

The hijack started when the flight left Khartoum for Amman on Monday night . 

The hijackers told the crew they had grenades and other explosives and threatened to blow up the plane if they were not taken to London . 

The airliner refuelled at Larnaca , Cyprus and landed at London 's Stansted airport in the early hours of Tuesday . 

Seven Iraqi suspected hijackers surrendered and British police said they had apparently asked for political asylum . 

Several had brought their families along , including children . 

Dole blasts Clinton for ignoring teen drug use . 

Judith Crosson 

<OOV> , Calif. 0000-00-00 

Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole Wednesday accused the Clinton administration of ignoring drug use among teenagers and said if elected he would use the National Guard to stop drugs from entering the United States . 

" He 'll probably mention his war on drugs , which he 's going to start like everything else -- next year . 

It 's too late , Mr. President , " Dole told an outdoor crowd of several hundred at a private religious school . 

He also commented briefly on published reports that the administration was planning to announce a plan to lower capital gains taxes for home sales . " 

Welcome to the club . 

We 've had it out there for weeks and weeks and weeks , " Dole said . 

Dole said former first lady Nancy Reagan was laughed at with her " just say no " anti-drug message . " 

But it worked , " Dole said . 

Meanwhile , in Los Angeles , Dole 's running mate , Jack Kemp , campaigned aggressively for the black vote in an area that was the flashpoint of the 0000 Los Angeles riots . 

Kemp told a crowd of about 000 African Americans in south central Los Angeles , " Keep your eyes open , keep your ears open , keep your heart open . 

I want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote . " 

In Dole 's address to a group that was largely white , the presidential nominee likened the stream of illegal drugs into the United States to missiles aimed at American children and promised to appoint federal judges who would be tough on illegal drug use . 

" They 're aiming millions and millions of missiles right at these young people , whether it 's a needle , whether it 's a cigarette , whatever the delivery system is -- it 's poison and it 's got to stop in America . " 

he said . 

Dole said 00 percent of the cocaine that entered the United States and 00 percent of the marijuana came from Mexico . " 

We 've got an international problem and I 'm prepared to use our military might . 

We want to stop drugs at the border , " he said . 

Dole 's remarks prompted questions about whether he was seeking a ban on cigarettes . " 

I did n't say anything about cigarettes . 

I was talking about drugs . 

I said you should n't smoke either . 

That 's all I said , " he replied as he was shaking hands with well-wishers . 

When asked specifically if he was suggesting a ban on cigarettes , Dole replied : " Oh no . 

Come on , you know better than that . " 

Dole campaign aides said the candidate was telling young people not to smoke . 

Dole also said he opposed California Proposition 000 which , if approved by voters , would allow the cultivation of marijuana plants for medicinal uses . 

Dole said the initiative would allow marijuana to be used for anything from a headache to an <OOV> toenail . 

In an effort to paint the drug issue in non-political terms , Dole said three times during his <OOV> address that illegal drug use was neither a Democratic nor a Republican issue but one that involves all people . 

The anti-drug message is a theme Dole feels has strong voter appeal . 

On Sunday near Chicago he accused President Bill Clinton of " raising the white flag " in the war on drugs . 

A recent survey showed that illegal drug use among 00-00 year-olds had doubled in the past four years . 

Dole was flanked by several California Republican politicians including Gov . 

Pete Wilson , who said local and state governments cannot fight illegal drugs alone . 

" We need all the help we can get . 

We need to get the kind of help we used to get when Ronald Reagan and George Bush were in the White House , " Wilson said .

CME lumber futures close lower on profit taking . 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

Profit taking continued to weigh on CME lumber futures but prices ended only slightly lower as strong cash markets underpinned futures , traders said . 

The same pattern of the past few days persisted with futures declining early on the profit taking before firming late . 

There was <OOV> buying late from people who want to take delivery of the September contract , they said . 

Cash sources noted that although the cash market is generally quiet , prices remain firm on demand for prompt delivery wood , they added . 

Random <OOV> quoted cash spruce at $ 000 per <OOV> , up $ 0 from last Friday and $ 0 over the last midweek quote . 

Reduced concern over Hurricane Edouard prompted some of the early profit taking . 

Expectations the storm would turn more to the north partly eased concerns , they said . 

Lumber closed $ 0.00 to $ 0.00 per <OOV> lower with September off $ 0.00 at $ 000.00 and November off most at $ 000.00 per <OOV> .

<OOV> boost U.S. HRW planting prospects .

KANSAS CITY , Mo .

<OOV> summer rainfall in the U.S. High Plains has produced <OOV> conditions for planting the 0000 hard red winter wheat crop , analysts said Wednesday . 

From central Texas north to Kansas , rains throughout July and August have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year . 

" Our moisture situation is excellent , especially for fall planting of winter wheat , " said Kim Anderson , extension wheat marketing economist at Oklahoma State University . 

The irony of the above-average summer rainfall was not lost on High Plains wheat producers , who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that old-timers likened conditions to the " Dust Bowl " days of the 0000s . 

" It 's definitely a turnabout from this past year , but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year , and then about October 0 it quit , " said Mark Hodges , executive director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission . " 

Hopefully that 's not going to happen this year . " 

According to figures released by the Oklahoma <OOV> Survey , an average of 00.00 inches fell across the state between March 0 and August 00 , 0000 . 

That 's about 0/0 inch above the average for the same time period , according to Howard Johnson , associate state <OOV> at the University of Oklahoma . 

He noted that the majority of that 00.00 inches had fallen since July . 

As an example of just how dry it was , data showed that between October 0 , 0000 and March 0 , 0000 , the state received an average of only 0.0 inches of rainfall . 

In northern Texas , the current rainfall situation was similar to most of Oklahoma , said Rodney <OOV> , executive assistant for the Texas Wheat Producers . 

" Up here in the Texas Panhandle , we 've had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat , " <OOV> said . 

But he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and southern Texas , where <OOV> levels were still short despite the rains brought by Hurricane Dolly last week . 

In Kansas , typically the number one U.S. hard red winter wheat producer , topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended Sunday , according to the state 's agricultural statistics service . 

In its weekly report released Monday , the service said Kansas topsoil moisture was rated eight percent surplus , 00 percent adequate and 00 percent short to very short . 

Oklahoma 's Agricultural Statistics Service showed similar conditions , rating topsoil moisture levels as seven percent surplus , 00 percent adequate and 00 percent short to very short . 

Data on topsoil moisture ratings were not released by the Texas Agricultural Statistics Service .

First Union National Bank of <OOV> settles suit . 

JACKSONVILLE , <OOV> 0000-00-00 

First Union National Bank of Florida said on Wednesday it agreed to settle a class action law suit involving its collateral protection insurance ( CPI ) program . 

To provide for the settlements , First Union has established a common fund of $ 0.0 million for cash refunds and $ 00.0 million in credit refunds for outstanding CPI balances . 

The bank is a division of First Union Corp . 

The bank said most of the charges resulted from loan portfolios from banks and thrifts that were acquired in the 0000s . 

First Union said it has discontinued CPI as an element of its motor vehicle or boat installment loan contracts . 

As part of the settlement agreement , customers who had CPI placed on loans from January 0 , 0000 to September 00 , 0000 , will receive cash or credit refunds , the bank said . 

Cash refunds will go to those who paid their loans to First Union while credit refunds will go to those who have existing loan balances , the bank said . 

Amoco says in talks over Yemen oil acreage . 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Amoco Corp officials said the company is in talks over crude oil production sharing in Yemen , but declined to comment on a published report Amoco had reached preliminary agreement on a block in the Shabwa area . 

" We 've been asked ( by Yemen ) not to comment ( on the talks ) , " said Amoco spokesman Dan <OOV> . " 

We can neither confirm nor deny that report , " he said . 

According to Middle East Economic Survey ( MEES ) , Yemen and Amoco signed a " memorandum of understanding " for a production-sharing agreement in Shabwa Block No . 

<OOV> in the former South Yemen , which united with North Yemen in 0000 . 

According to another Amoco official , the company is not exploring now for oil anywhere in Yemen . 

The officials said Amoco was deferring to the Yemeni Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals for any specific comments on the <OOV> talks . 

The former Soviet Union was displaced as contractor of the potentially rich Shabwa oilfields once it collapsed in December 0000 , according to the International Petroleum Encyclopedia .

Burundi defends military regime to hostile UN . 

Evelyn Leopold 

UNITED NATIONS 0000-00-00 

Burundi 's ambassador on Wednesday lashed out at economic sanctions imposed by African states and said any thought of an arms embargo would be a windfall for guerrillas fighting his army-run government . 

In a lengthy debate on Burundi before the U.N. Security Council , Ambassador Nsanze Terence said the new military government took over to stabilise the country and wanted negotiations under former Tanzanian President Julius <OOV> . 

Nearly every African member who spoke , as well as most Security Council members , however , were unsympathetic towards the government of President Pierre Buyoya , an army major put in power in a July coup by the <OOV> military , which is locked in a guerrilla war with the majority Hutus . 

" These ( African ) brothers should have been the first to bind the wounds of Burundi , " Terence said of the economic embargo . " 

Quite the contrary , Burundi has seen economic war declared against it by fellow African people ... a gratuitous immolation of the people of Burundi . " 

He said his government had just asked U.N. human rights monitors to increase their numbers in Burundi in an effort " to put an end to this vicious circle of violence . " 

More than 000,000 people have been killed in violence between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus since 0000 . 

Botswana 's envoy , <OOV> <OOV> , said coups should be relegated " to the dump heap of history " as there could be no justification for the overthrow of a legitimate government . 

Chile has proposed a resolution , still under discussion , that would impose an immediate arms embargo on Burundi and call for negotiations . 

The draft suggests further sanctions against those who impede a political solution . 

Among the council 's five permanent members , Russia and the United States appeared to support most elements of the Chilean proposal , while Britain , France and China were cautious . 

Terence , a Tutsi , said any arms embargo would leave the army unable to defend itself against Hutu guerrillas and leave the population exposed to " armed <OOV> . " 

But Chilean Ambassador Juan Somavia said : " Every weapon that reached Burundi is a weapon aimed mainly at killing an unarmed civilian . 

We must not send a signal different from the African leaders themselves . 

Inaction is becoming the worst possible course of action . " 

Burundi 's parliament has been suspended and political parties are banned but Terence told reporters Buyoya would reconvene a new type of national assembly in October . 

The United States said the coup leaders had taken no steps to restore democracy and indiscriminate killings continued . 

Ambassador Karl Inderfurth said the new government should have " unconditional " negotiations with all parties inside and outside of the country . 

He said Washington strongly supported the economic sanctions imposed already and if these did not work the council would consider " an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders . " 

But he said the international community had to be prepared for the worst and avoid a replay of the horrors in neighbouring Rwanda , where widespread genocide broke out against the Tutsis two years ago . 

He again said the United Nations should draw up contingency plans for a rapid humanitarian intervention . 

Swiss arrest Rwandan on genocide suspicion .

<OOV> rally draws about 0,000 in Karachi . 

KARACHI , Pakistan 0000-00-00 

About 0,000 protesters marched through Karachi on Wednesday demanding the removal of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , witnesses said . 

" From here we will march to Islamabad and by God we will not let Benazir and ( Bhutto 's husband Asif Ali ) Zardari escape justice , " Nawaz Sharif , leader of the main opposition Pakistan Muslim League told a rally organised by a <OOV> alliance . 

Sharif accused Bhutto of corruption and nepotism , charges she has denied in the past . 

Witnesses said protesters carrying colourful party flags walked for several miles , chanting anti-government slogans . 

The event was part of an opposition campaign launched on August 00 , Pakistan 's independence day . 

Sharif said similar rallies would be held in the Balochistan provincial capital Quetta and the Punjab provincial capital Lahore before an opposition march on the capital Islamabad . 

" I promise the people of Karachi that those responsible for the extra-judicial killing of innocent youths would not be spared , " Sharif said . 

Karachi 's ethnic Mohajir National Movement ( MQM ) accuses the government of killing many of its militants in cold blood . 

The government has denied the charge and blames the MQM for much of the violence that killed 0,000 people in the city last year . 

Political observers said the turn-out was disappointing for a city of about 00 million people , possibly indicating that the MQM , although a member of the opposition alliance , had not mobilised its supporters for the event . 

The turbulent southern port has been calmer this year , but police say more than 000 people have died in political unrest . 

The MQM speaks for Urdu-speaking Moslems who migrated from India at Partition in 0000 and their descendants . 

Sharif , a former prime minister , is the main political rival of Bhutto , who defeated him in the October 0000 election . 

He said only the removal of the government and an early election could save Pakistan from disaster . " 

We will dislodge the Bhutto government . 

It is a holy war for us , " he said . 

Bhutto has vowed to complete her five-year term . 

India ACC <OOV> ' 00 sales , output up . 

BOMBAY 0000-00-00 

India 's leading cement firm Associated Cement Companies ( ACC ) said on Wednesday its cement sales rose to 0.0 million tonnes in April-July 0000 from 0.00 million a year ago . 

ACC Chairman Nani Palkhivala told shareholders at the firm 's annual meeting cement output rose to 0.00 million tonnes in the first quarter of 0000/00 ( April-March ) , from 0.00 million a year ago . 

Palkhivala said ACC had secured government approval to take over a sick cement firm with a grinding capacity of 000,000 tonnes per year . " 

We will take it over early next month , " he said . 

Talking about the cement industry in general , Palkhivala said Indian production rose by about 00 percent in 0000/00 . 

" The industry saw capacity expansion of about 00 percent over 0000/00 from 00.00 million tonnes to 00.00 million tonnes , " Palkhivala told shareholders . 

He said Indian cement exports dropped about eight percent from the previous year because of stiff international competition and inadequate infrastructural facilities . 

ACC 's own export performance was marginally better than in 0000/00 on account of a 00 percent rise in exports to Nepal and the opening of a new market - Sri Lanka , he said . 

Despite power shortages , ACC achieved a satisfactory growth in production during the year with the help of its power plants . 

ACC sold 0.0 million tonnes in 0000/00 , retaining its top position in the Indian cement industry , Palkhivala said .

India fishermen say forced to carry Tamil refugees . 

P.V. <OOV> 

<OOV> , India 0000-00-00 

Indian fishermen said on Wednesday they had been forced at gunpoint to ferry refugees fleeing the ethnic war in Sri Lanka to India , as a protest strike by more than 00,000 fishermen entered its ninth day . 

" There is little we can do when at mid-sea . 

The LTTE ( Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ) <OOV> us and , at the point of a gun , forces us to take refugees , " said senior fishermen leader P. <OOV> . 

Some 000 refugees have landed in recent weeks at the port of Rameswaram in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu , home to 00 million Tamil-speaking people , port officials say . 

Rameswaram is 00 km ( 00 miles ) off the coast of Sri Lanka . 

State chief minister M. Karunanidhi has publicly welcomed the refugees , who are fleeing the 00-year war between Tamil separatists and government troops that Colombo says has cost 00,000 lives . 

But the influx has triggered fears of a repeat of the 0000s when some 000,000 refugees landed in Tamil Nadu . 

Intelligence officals said more than 0,000 Tamils were waiting on the western coast of Sri Lanka to cross into India . 

The Indian government has warned its fishermen that their boats would be impounded if they were caught ferrying refugees . 

The fishermen went on strike last week to protest the government 's cancellation of three trawlers ' fishing licenses after the boats were caught carrying Tamil refugees . 

All Fishermen 's Association secretary N.J. Bose said the strike would continue indefinitely and the fishermen would block road and rail traffic if their demands were not met . 

" Until the government releases our boats from naval custody and Sri Lankan naval custody , and gives us assurance ( it will not revoke licences of boats ferrying refugees ) , we will not call off our strike , " Bose said . 

LTTE spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment , but Sri Lankan fishermen denied that Indians were being coerced into carrying refugees across the Palk Strait . 

" Indian fishermen come right up to <OOV> to fish , and when refugees request them to ferry them across , they readily oblige . 

Only some take money , " Sri Lankan boatman <OOV> said . 

<OOV> denied the fishermen charged the refugees for passage to India and said it was unfair to penalise them for the refugees ' arrival . 

" We have not gone to sea since August 00 , but refugees are arriving daily nevertheless . 

How could we alone be held responsible for the influx ? " 

he said . 

An Indian Fisheries Department official said the government planned to urge fishermen not to cross the international boundary between India and Sri Lanka , but admitted this would be hard to enforce because of Sri Lanka 's <OOV> waters .

Conservative New Democracy ( ND ) party leader Miltiadis Evert will be hitting the campaign trail and head to Alexandroupolis this weekend to speak to the city 's businessmen on Sunday morning , ND said . 

Evert will depart for Alexandroupolis on Saturday afternoon . 

Prime Minister Costas Simitis criticized Evert today for unleashing a seven-point economic package that offers tax relief to merchants and other professionals , higher pensions to farmers and support for small business . 

The finance ministry estimated the cost of ND 's economic measures to over 000 billion drachmas but ND officials put the figure much lower to about 000 billion drachmas . 

Simitis blamed ND for the low absorption rate of EU funds and said the socialists will increase farmers ' pensions , combat tax evasion and accelerate GDP growth rates to 0.0 percent in a few years . 

Faster economic growth is a major component of ND 's economic programme and Evert has repeatedly blamed the socialists for the slow economic growth .

One focus was British Airways , which rebounded after fears faded that the cancellation of " open skies " talks between the U.S. Transportation Department and the British government may jeopardise its tie-up with American Airlines . 

The conclusion of an open skies agreement had been made a prerequisite of the proposed link-up by the U.S . 

Better-than-expected British trade figures had little impact on equities . 

The non-EU July trade deficit totalled 000 million sterling ( $ 000 million ) while June 's world deficit was 0.00 billion pounds . 

Forecasts were for deficits of 000 million sterling and 0.0 billion sterling . 

German shares shed some gains on profit-taking but nonetheless ended the floor session higher buoyed by demand for chemical stocks and a stable dollar . 

The 00-share DAX index closed at 0,000.00 points , up 0.00 . 

However , French stocks extended opening losses to more than one percent in morning trading , falling through the 0000 point resistance level on the main CAC-00 index . 

Dealers blamed a weakening franc and worries about the 0000 budget and possible autumn strikes 

Louis Viannet , leader of France 's Communist-led CGT union , criticised government plans for spending cuts in the 0000 budget on Wednesday and warned of labour unrest as France gets back to work after the holidays . 

Later in the day , helped by the firmer Wall Street opening , Paris climbed back to the 0000 level but still remained well into negative territory . 

In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around 000.00 yen in the European afternoon , up from its European close on Tuesday of 000.00 but off the day 's highs . 

It had been boosted overnight by the Bank of Japan 's quarterly corporate survey , or " tankan " , of major manufacturers -- an important gauge of business sentiment . 

The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rock-bottom levels -- weakening the yen . 

The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of 0.0 percent . 

The BOJ sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists ' predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year . 

A BOJ spokesman said " the doors to the recovery have not been shut ... 

the recovery is still continuing . " 

These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further . 

" The dollar 's gains were less than spectacular , suggesting that while it 's likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations , a breakout from the established trading range does n't appear likely , " said currency economist Klaus Baader . 

Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production , showing the economy was still faltering .

Arafat says Israel declares war on Palestinians . 

Wafa Amr 

RAMALLAH , West Bank 0000-00-00 

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Wednesday that Israel had declared war on the Palestinians and called for the first general strike in the West Bank and Gaza in two years . 

" What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people , " Arafat told the Palestinian legislature . 

Accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of stupidity , Arafat launched his strongest attack on the right-wing government since its election in May . 

The tirade was sparked by Israel 's announcement on Tuesday of plans to expand the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Sefer and its demolishing of a community centre in Arab East Jerusalem . 

" Israel has started the war on Jerusalem . 

They are idiots to have started the Jerusalem battle , " Arafat said in Arabic . " 

There will be no Palestinian state without Jerusalem . 

Netanyahu should know he is stupid to have started this battle . " 

Arafat called for a general strike " for Jerusalem " on Thursday in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip . 

There has not been a joint shutdown there since May 0000 when Israeli troops began withdrawing under an interim self-rule agreement signed in 0000 . 

The strike will have little effect on the Israeli economy while hurting Palestinian merchants in East Jerusalem and Bethlehem who cater to the tourist trade . 

Some 00,000 Palestinian labourers are likely to stay away from their jobs , mainly in construction , in Israel . 

But Palestinians , once the backbone of the building industry , have been largely replaced by labourers from Romania and China . 

" On Friday , all Moslems , including Palestinians in Israel ... 

will go to ( Jerusalem 's ) Al-Aqsa mosque and pray . 

Jews and Christians who do not pray should accompany them and stand behind them , " Arafat said . 

Officials in Netanyahu 's office were not immediately available for comment on Arafat 's remarks . 

Israeli travel restrictions , imposed after bombings by Moslem militants in February and March , ban most of the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza from entering Jerusalem . 

Netanyahu , who opposes trading occupied land for peace , made Jerusalem a central issue in his election campaign , accusing Labour Prime Minister Shimon Peres of planning to hand control of the Arab eastern part of the city to the Palestinians . 

Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 0000 Middle East war and claims both halves of the city as its capital . 

The PLO wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state . 

In his speech to the crowded legislature , Arafat signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although " alarm bells are ringing " . 

He unexpectedly broke off his address to take a telephone call from U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross , who held talks in Paris on Tuesday with Israeli and Egyptian officials . 

When Arafat returned to the podium , he said senior PLO negotiator Mahmoud Abbas , better known as Abu Mazen , and Netanyahu aide Dore Gold could meet on Thursday . 

He quoted Ross as telling him : " The important thing is the Israelis are prepared to move . " 

Arafat said he replied : " is this like their previous promises ? " 

" No , they have good intentions , " Arafat quoted Ross as saying . 

Palestinians have been pressing Israel to carry out a long-delayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron agreed by the previous Labour government . 

The Israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai which are likely to demand a wider than agreed army presence in Hebron .

US investors mull appeal of Lloyd 's decision . 

Patricia <OOV> 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

U.S. investors in troubled Lloyd 's of London were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a U.S. court decision in favour of Lloyd 's and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions . 

A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday gave Lloyd 's a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse . 

A lower court issued the injunction on Friday and ordered Lloyd 's to give investors , known as Names , more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan . 

" My prediction is that the Names will appeal , " said Kenneth Chiate , a U.S. Name and a chief negotiator for the American Names Association . 

" At this point , it is a sufficiently important decision that I 'm confident that they will appeal , " he said . " 

But to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court 's ruling is . " 

Under the reorganisation plan , Lloyd 's plans to <OOV> its massive liabilities into a new company called Equitas . 

The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund Equitas but also provides them with 0.0 billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities . 

The Names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by 0000 GMT Wednesday , but Lloyd 's chairman David Rowland said on Tuesday the offer would be extended . 

At least eight U.S. states have still some form of litigation pending , said John Head , spokesman for the Association of Lloyd 's State Chairmen , a group representing U.S. Names . 

" It goes without saying that we 're rather disappointed , " Head said of the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , sitting in Baltimore . 

But , he said , " we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this . " 

The Colorado attorney general told Lloyd 's last week it was considering a new legal action against the British insurance market , based on allegations of consumer fraud . 

" We have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response , " said Colorado attorney general Gale Norton . 

Norton said she was concerned that the Lloyd 's agreement <OOV> it from future litigation regarding Equitas and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of Colorado . 

In addition , she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional , future liabilities . 

Meanwhile , an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some 000 Names in California is still pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , Chiate of the American Names Association said . 

That lawsuit , which seeks <OOV> and restitution , was dismissed in a U.S. district court . 

That case " is what I call the most significant alternate remedy for us , " Chiate said . 

The individual Names , however , now must decide whether to accept Lloyd 's settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation . 

Chiate said he has advised Names that " they must make , individually , a risk benefit analysis . " 

Rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing Lloyd 's two to three times more than Lloyd 's is now willing to accept , he said . 

But , in rejecting the offer , the Names would retain their rights to pursue litigation , he said . 

German police made Nazi gestures , officials say . 

NUREMBERG , Germany 0000-00-00 

German riot police made Nazi gestures at a private function earlier this month and may face dismissal for their actions , the Bavarian Interior Ministry said on Wednesday . 

The ministry declined to detail gestures the <OOV> policemen had made at the August 00 function but added seven had been suspended from duty pending an internal inquiry . 

A spokesman for public prosecutors in the southern city , where dictator Adolf Hitler held some of his most infamous Nazi party rallies in the 0000s , said there were no plans to prosecute the officers as the gestures had not been made in public .

BERLIN 0000-00-00 

A motorist threatened a fellow driver with a starting pistol as he overtook him illegally in the inside lane on a motorway near Berlin and was photographed in the act by the driver 's wife , prosecutors said on Wednesday . 

Prosecutors in the city of Potsdam said the 00-year-old man drew alongside the other car at about 000 kph ( 00 mph ) and aimed his pistol at the driver . 

But the driver 's wife kept her nerve , got out her camera and photographed him . 

The man has been charged with dangerous driving , coercion and threatening behaviour . 

German prosecutors file sex tourism charges . 

BERLIN 0000-00-00 

Berlin prosecutors said on Wednesday they had filed charges against two German men for sexually abusing children in Thailand and distributing pornographic films and pictures of their degrading acts . 

The case is one of only a handful in which authorities have managed to track down suspects under a law which lets them pursue Germans who commit sex offences abroad . 

The pair , identified only as 00-year-old clerk Dieter U and businessman Thomas S , 00 , are alleged to have carried out acts of sexual indecency with children as young as 00 years old between 0000 and 0000 . 

Their videos included pictures of one of the accused tying up a Thai boy and performing acts of sadistic torture on him , prosecutors said in a statement . 

In another scene , a young girl performed oral sex with an unidentified adult man . 

The new law was introduced with much fanfare in 0000 . 

But prosecutors face huge difficulties in gathering evidence and bringing witnesses to testify in a German court , and only one person has so far been convicted under the law . 

Investigators are probing several other cases . 

The Berlin prosecutors said they had been alerted to the two men by customs officials who intercepted packages containing pornographic photographs and order forms .

Stephanie of Monaco 's husband snapped cavorting . 

ROME 0000-00-00 

Two Italian magazines published pictures on Wednesday of Daniel Ducruet , Princess Stephanie of Monaco 's husband and former bodyguard , cavorting naked with another woman by a poolside in France . 

The magazines , Eva <OOV> and its sister publication Gente , printed up to 00 pages of photos of the woman undressing Ducruet , the pair embracing on a <OOV> and finally both naked . 

Eva <OOV> said other even more explicit photos were taken but it did not print them . 

The magazines named the woman as Fili Houteman , a 00-year-old French singer and dancer in a Belgian cabaret club . 

The photographs , an Italian exclusive , raised eyebrows in the tiny principality , where Stephanie 's father Prince Rainier , had long disapproved of his daughter 's choice of husband . 

Stephanie had two children with Ducruet before their marriage in July last year . 

Stephanie , Caroline and Albert are the children of Rainier and former Hollywood screen goddess Grace Kelly , who was killed in a car crash in 0000 . 

" We have seen the photos but for the moment the palace has no comment , " a spokeswoman for Prince Rainier told Reuters . 

The magazines said the photographs were taken in Cap de Villefranche , some 00 km ( nine miles ) from Monte Carlo . 

Gente said Ducruet , a keen racing driver , met Houteman during a race in Belgium and photographers had been on their trail ever since . 

The magazine said video cameras had also been used to film the couple and that a <OOV> existed .

Revellers painted the town red on Wednesday as the 0000 edition of the world 's biggest tomato fight began in the eastern Spanish village of <OOV> . 

Thousands of people pelted each other with armfuls of ripe tomatoes as streets , walls and windows were coated in a blood-red wash .

NZ bills gain ground after see-saw session . 

WELLINGTON 0000-00-00 

0000 GMT 

The New Zealand money market gained slightly at Wednesday 's close after what dealers described as a see-saw trading session . 

Ninety-day bank bill rates shed five points to 0.00 percent and September bank bill futures rose four to 00.00 . 

However , bonds finished largely flat . 

" Our bonds were better bid initially but they sold off on a lack of demand , and the short end went with it too on a lower currency . 

" There were big buyers at the base of where the market sold to , and when the currency got bought back on talk of a samurai the market got bought back again , " a dealer said . 

Volumes were reasonable in the money market but thin in bonds . 

Dealers said the market seemed to be trading a range and would wait for more political polls to provide direction . 

They were confident of further <OOV> issuance but said the timing was less of a certainty .

RTRS - Guinness Peat expects strong full yr . 

SYDNEY 0000-00-00 

British-based investment company Guinness Peat Group Plc ( GPG ) said on Wednesday it expected a strong full year result . 

" We think we 're in a position to produce a strong result , however a lot of our profitability must inevitably depend on a number of ( company ) results , " said GPG director Garry Weiss . 

GPG earlier said its net profit for the six months to June 00 rose to 0.00 million pounds from 0.00 million in the previous first half . 

The company did not declare an interim dividend as in the previous year . 

Weiss said the Australian share market had been somewhat negative for much of 0000 and this had some effect on the company 's first half results . 

" However , it certainly is a very pleasing result for the first six months , " he said . 

Weiss said most of the company 's half year earning stemmed from the sale of its 00 percent stake in Physicians Insurance Co of Ohio . 

He said the company decided to sell its U.S. investment in order to consolidate investments closer to its administrative base . 

GPG said its stakes in Tyndall Australia Ltd and Mid-East Minerals Ltd both contributed strongly to GPG 's first half earnings .

Earlier , Newcrest reported a drop in net profit after abnormals to A$ 00.00 million for the year from A$ 00.0 million the previous year . 

Newcrest said earnings from the Telfer and Boddington mines were lower than the previous year due to lower head grades at the mines , forcing gold production lower . 

Production costs also rose eight percent during the year to A$ 000 per ounce . 

RTRS - Queensland gunman evades police in bush hunt . 

BRISBANE 0000-00-00 

Australian police on Wednesday continued to hunt a gunman in dense bushland after he killed his wife and wounded three other people , warning the man is extremely dangerous and may take a hostage to escape . 

The shooting occured around 0.00 a.m. ( 0000 GMT ) on Tuesday at Glenwood , south of <OOV> , about 000 km ( 00 miles ) north of Brisbane on the Queensland state coast . 

Police have declared an " emergent situation " in the area , giving them powers to raid houses , search cars , close schools , quarantine the area and evacuate people . 

" It is one step short of an emergency situation , " a police spokesman said via telephone from a command post in the bush . 

" We have not had any sightings , but we suspect he is armed , possibly with a .00 rifle and / or a self-loading shotgun . 

He is considered extremely dangerous , " he said . 

" It 's a possibility , not a probability , he may take a hostage , but we have measures in place if that is the case . " 

William Fox broke into his wife 's home on Tuesday morning , shooting her dead and wounding his 00-year-old son , his son 's girlfriend and a neighbour , police said . 

All three wounded are in a satisfactory condition in hospital . 

Fox initially fled from the shooting in a car , but then abandoned the car and entered dense bushland . 

Fox is a skilled bushman who knows the area very well , police said . 

About 00 police , helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft have maintained an overnight cordon around 00 sq km ( six sq miles ) of bush near Glenwood . 

The area is littered with caves and police believed Fox has a hideout which has enabled him to evade capture .

Khmer Rouge 's Ieng Sary confirms break with Pol Pot . 

ARANYAPRATHET , Thailand 0000-00-00 

Dissident Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary confirmed on Wednesday that he had broken with Pol Pot and other hardliners of the guerrilla group and had formed a rival movement . 

Ieng Sary said in a written statement , the first since his split with Pol Pot earlier this month , that the new movement to be called the Democratic National United Movement ( DNUM ) would seek an end to civil war and work towards reconciliation with the Cambodian government . 

" I would like to inform you about my decision to break away from Pol Pot , Ta Mok , Son Sen 's dictatorial group , " he said in a copy of the statement obtained by Reuters . 

" We believe that our country will be reduced to nothing if the Khmer people continue to fight against each other indefinitely .... 

For this reason we decided to break away from that dictatorial group and found a movement named ' Democratic National United Movement ' , " he said . 

Ieng Sary was sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the mass genocide in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge rule of terror between 0000-0000 when over a million people were executed or died of starvation , disease or overwork in mass labour camps . 

The French-educated , former brother-in-law of Pol Pot was foreign minister in the Khmer Rouge government that ruled Cambodia and was seen as the group 's second in command .

MOF 's Kubo says believes BOJ rate policy unchanged . 

TOKYO 0000-00-00 

Japan 's Finance Minister Wataru Kubo told a news conference on Wednesday that he believes that the Bank of Japan 's ( BOJ ) interest rate policy which is geared towards ensuring economic growth has not changed after the release of the central bank 's " tankan " survey . 

The BOJ released the August tankan , its quarterly short-term corporate survey , in the morning and it showed business outlook had worsened . 

However , Kubo said it did not necessarily show a substantial worsening of the economy . 

" The question is what the BOJ is going to do with its interest rate policy . 

The BOJ governor has made it clear that the BOJ 's policy is aimed at ensuring basis for economic recovery . 

I believe this policy has not changed , " he said . 

Asked if a supplementary budget for 0000/00 was needed to support the economy , Kubo said the tankan results would not lead to any immediate decision on the need for an extra budget . 

" I do n't think we should immediately draw a conclusion that the economic recovery has come to a halt or that signs of a economic contraction have emerged , " Kubo said . " 

The economy is not recovering smoothly or at a fast pace . " 

Kubo said he would make a decision on the need for a supplementary budget after an announcement in mid-September of Japan 's gross domestic product for the April-June quarter . 

" I would like to see how the economy moved in the first half of 0000 , " he said . 

China says militant Japan must face war past . 

BEIJING 0000-00-00 

China on Wednesday called on Japan to acknowledge its wartime past and put a stop to a tide of resurgent militarism to prevent similar atrocities in future . 

" Some Japanese are still unrepentant about the atrocities committed by the Japanese militarists during the war , " said a commentary in the official China Daily . 

" If they are still undecided whether the war Japan launched was aggressive in nature , it will be difficult to tell whether they will do the same again , " the newspaper said . 

China raised indignant protests after several Japanese cabinet ministers visited a shrine dedicated to their country 's war dead on August 00 , the 00st anniversary of Japan 's World War Two surrender . 

" Numerous Japanese politicians have tried to whitewash their country 's war atrocities in recent years , " the commentary said . 

China estimates 00 million Chinese were killed or wounded by invading Japanese troops from 0000 to 0000 . 

" The Japanese have never genuinely apologised for their wartime crimes , " the commentary said . 

Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto marked the August 00 anniversary by expressing " remorse " for foreign victims of Japan 's World War Two atrocities . 

Japan coalition party leader plans to resign . 

TOKYO 0000-00-00 

The leader of a junior partner in Japan 's three-party ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion , party officials said on Wednesday . 

The officials said New Party Sakigake President Masayoshi Takemura , finance minister until the beginning of this year , promised his resignation in a meeting with the politician who set off the rebellion in the smallest coalition member . 

They said the date of Takemura 's resignation would be determined by party officials . 

The Sakigake row has caused jitters in its coalition partners , Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto 's Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , the biggest grouping , and the Social Democratic Party . 

But analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if Sakigake splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election . 

The dispute pits Takemura , who founded Sakigake in 0000 as a reform-oriented LDP splinter group , against party official Yukio Hatoyama , who says he will leave Sakigake to form a reformist political group next month . 

Hatoyama , the 00-year-old grandson of a 0000s prime minister , on Tuesday quit as Sakigake secretary general and has publicly snubbed the 00-year-old Takemura , pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force . 

Marathon talks between the two former allies on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of Takemura , seen by Hatoyama backers as tainted by his senior role in the <OOV> coalition . 

The presence of Takemura , whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer , has stalled Hatoyama 's efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp , analysts said . 

Media reports say that at most 00 of 00 Sakigake members , joined by a handful of Social Democrats , will follow Hatoyama when he bolts -- far short of the 00 lawmakers needed to topple Hashimoto 's eight-month-old government . 

Hashimoto -- who returns from a 00-day Latin American tour on Saturday -- must call polls by <OOV> , and has repeatedly said he would not call an early general election . 

But many analysts and politicians believe he may dissolve parliament soon after it reconvenes in early October .

HONG KONG 0000-00-00 

With 000 days to go before the British colony reverts to China , the Hong Kong media focused mainly on domestic issues concerning alleged pressure on a judge , cross straights relations and the democratic lobby 's relationship with Beijing . 

The Beijing-funded WEN WEI PO said Taiwan 's government could not hope to stem the island 's economic and trade exchanges with China . 

The paper said that using administrative power to limit economic activities across the Taiwan strait would not work . 

MING PAO DAILY NEWS said it hoped Chinese officials would soon open dialogue with Hong Kong 's Democratic Party and the newly-established democracy lobby , Frontier , in order to ease anxieties in the lead-up to the handover . 

The English language SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST said the judiciary needed to take swift and decisive action in investigating the allegations that a judge had been subjected to pressure in a New Zealand immigration case involving allegations of fraud . 

The independence of the judiciary and the rule of law were of paramount importance to Hong Kong 's survival as a business centre . 

The Chinese language daily HONG KONG ECONOMIC TIMES said the Legal Department had been indecisive in its handling of the judge 's case . 

Such hesitancy on the part of the government had damaged public confidence in the rule of law , the paper said .

Iran asks Bonn to extradite ex-president Banisadr . 

BONN 0000-00-00 

Iran has asked Germany to extradite its former president Abolhassan Banisadr for alleged hijacking , an Iranian embassy spokesman said on Wednesday . 

Banisadr angered Tehran last week by accusing top Iranian leaders of ordering the assassination of Iranian Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 0000 . 

He made the allegations at the trial of an Iranian and four Lebanese accused of carrying out the attack . 

An Iranian embassy spokesman said in response to an inquiry that Iran had formally requested Banisadr 's extradition for hijacking the military aircraft which he commandeered to flee Iran in July 0000 . 

" We submitted the request three or four days ago , " he said . 

German authorities could not immediately be reached for comment . 

Banisadr lives under round-the-clock security in France , fearing Tehran could make an attempt on his life . 

He is due back in Berlin on September 0 to continue his testimony , which has backed up German prosecutors ' allegations that Tehran ordered the attack on the exiled leaders . 

Three dissidents and their translator were killed in the gangland-style machinegun attack . 

Iran has warned Germany that bilateral relations could suffer if it pays heed to the testimony of Banisadr , an architect of Iran 's Islamic revolution who has been a sworn enemy of Tehran since he fell from favour after a year as president .

ISS says agreed sale of U.S. unit . 

COPENHAGEN 0000-00-00 

Danish cleaning group ISS on Wednesday said it had signed a letter of intent to sell its troubled U.S unit ISS Inc to Canadian firm Aaxis Limited .

Iraq balks at U.N. staff for oil-for-food deal . 

Evelyn Leopold 

UNITED NATIONS 0000-00-00 

Iraq has balked at the number of U.N. staff needed to implement the oil-for-food deal , blaming the United States for insisting on stringent monitoring . 

In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday , Iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff , which Baghdad has to finance , surpasses funds allocated for electricity , water , sewers , education and agriculture . 

At issue was a May 00 agreement allowing Iraq to sell $ 0 billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food , medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded Kuwait in August 0000 . 

The Iraqi statement said the United States was " interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified . " 

Iraq 's deputy ambassador , Saeed Hasan , noted that the May 00 accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the United Nations and that the government of Iraq would be consulted . 

Saeed in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the U.N. officials said they expected it to go into force next month after Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reports that arrangements are in place . 

The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs ( DHA ) , which has to coordinate the distribution of food , medicine and other goods , increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the United States . 

According to U.N. officials and diplomats , Iraq would have about $ 0.00 billion to spend for food , medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for Gulf War victims and costs for U.N. weapons inspections were deducted . 

The cost of the U.N. staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost $ 00 million . 

In addition another $ 00 million was anticipated to cover other expenses , such as oil experts and administrative costs . 

For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the United Nations estimated it needed 0,000 people , including 000 international staff and 000 Iraqi support staff . 

Of this number 00 foreign and 000 local staff would be in the northern Kurdish provinces , no longer the direct control of the Baghdad government . 

Another 000 international staff and 000 Iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country . 

There are also 00 monitors to watch oil flows , 00 customs experts and four New York-based oil experts or overseers to approve contracts . 

Yasushi Akashi , the DHA undersecretary-general , told the Security Council last week that the " financial requirements to support the ( humanitarian ) programme represent a very modest <OOV> of the total ... 

roughly 0 percent . "

EU Commission cool on changing beef cull plan . 

BRUSSELS 0000-00-00 

The European Commission said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying Britain 's mad cow epidemic would die out by 0000 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign . 

" Obviously we are interested in this research . 

We will ask the ( EU ) scientific and veterinary committee to examine it , " Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely told Reuters . 

But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , a fatal brain-wasting disease suffered by cattle , was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by Britain and its 00 EU partners . 

" We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible . 

I think it would be very difficult to sell to the European Commission a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer BSE cases , " Kiely said . 

" We will look at our approach ( to the plan ) but we wo n't get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered , " he said . 

" We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered , that 's not the issue . 

The issue is the protection of consumers ' health and the rapid eradication of BSE , " he added . 

The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers , who seized on research by Oxford scientists in the scientific journal Nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 0000 without killing vast numbers of cattle . 

The researchers predicted there would be 000 new infections and 00,000 new cases of BSE before 0000 . 

British farmers ' leader called on Wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report . 

" I hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue , " National Farmers Union president Sir David Naish told BBC radio . 

Naish said there was no need for Britain to carry out a planned cull of some 000,000 cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its European partners . 

" The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be re-examined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout Europe accepted this evidence , " Naish said . 

The report could well reopen a damaging row between Britain and the EU , which slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after the government said there could be a link between BSE and the human form of the disease . 

The issue flared in in March when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) from eating BSE-infected beef . 

French farmers set up blockades in mad cow protest . 

PARIS 0000-00-00 

Thousands of farmers threw up roadblocks across France overnight , stopping and checking lorries suspected of importing meat from outside the European Union , French radios reported on Thursday . 

Radio stations said around 00,000 farmers , angered by a fall in beef prices following the mad cow disease crisis , staged protests in many areas and blockaded several main roads and motorways . 

By 0 a.m. ( 0000 GMT ) more than 0,000 lorries had been stopped and searched . 

European beef sales plunged after Britain announced the discovery of a likely link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) , or mad cow disease , and its fatal human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease ( CJD ) .

CRICKET - <OOV> <OOV> PAKISTAN TO 000-0 . 

MANCHESTER , England 0000-00-00 

Tight bowling from Glamorgan off-spinner Robert Croft helped England to restrict Pakistan to 000 for five in their 00 overs in the first one-day international at Old Trafford on Thursday . 

Croft , who was one of the few Englishmen to make a good impression in his test debut at The Oval last week , showed great control as he first dried up the early flow of Pakistan runs and then collected the wickets of Aamir Sohail and Wasim Akram in a spell of 00-0-00-0 . 

There was also a wicket each for Ronnie Irani , Allan Mullally and Darren Gough although there was no joy for Dean Headley who , along with Lancashire batsman Graham Lloyd , was making his international debut . 

After Wasim had won the toss and chosen to bat first , Pakistani made an excellent start as Sohail and Saeed Anwar continued their good form with an opening partnership of 00 . 

Anwar , who struck a superb 000 at The Oval , was the more aggressive as he made 00 from 00 balls before skying a catch off Irani to Mullally at long-on . 

Sohail and Ijaz Ahmed then added 00 for the second wicket before England struck back with three wickets for 00 in the space of five overs . 

First , Sohail , after making 00 , was bowled by Croft as he stepped back to try and hit through the off-side . 

Wasim , who promoted himself to number four in the order , followed for six when Croft drifted another well-flighted delivery behind his legs . 

Shortly after Ijaz was also back in the pavilion for 00 after Irani had repaid Mullally with another good catch at long-on . 

Gough later bowled Moin Khan with an inswinging yorker but Inzamam-ul-Haq , 00 not out , and Salim Malik took Pakistan to 000 for five when the overs ran out .

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Conchita Martinez decided that when in New York , do as the New Yorkers do -- and the Spaniard 's new-found aggressiveness seems to have put her in the right frame of mind for the U.S. Open . 

The fourth-seeded Spaniard , who is tackling the world class traffic of New York City as a warm-up by driving to the tennis centre for her matches , ran over France 's Nathalie Tauziat 0-0 0-0 on Wednesday to take her place in the third round . 

" I 've been trying my whole career to be aggressive , " said the 00-year-old Martinez after crushing Tauziat in just over an hour . 

" What I 'm trying to do is be aggressive all the time , maybe go up to the net a few times like I did tonight . 

That would really help . " 

Martinez , the 0000 Wimbledon champion , used to struggle at the Open , but has come to terms with the noise , crowds and chaos . 

" There is a lot of things that can happen , " Martinez said about her early difficulties adjusting to tennis on the cement at Flushing Meadows . 

" Like traffic . 

We stay in Manhattan and it 's a long way to come . 

The crowds , they speak louder or they move . 

That does n't happen in other Grand Slams . 

That 's where the real champion wins . 

You have to concentrate for these two weeks . " 

It took Martinez four Opens to get as far as the quarters , and another four to match that . 

Last year , Martinez , who finished 0000 ranked second in the world , reached the semifinals before bowing out to Monica Seles . 

Now she feels she is in the swing of things . 

" I have my own car now and that helps , " said Martinez . 

" Sometimes the transportation they ( the tournament ) provide gets a little messed up . 

This time it did n't happen . 

I do the driving and I love it . 

It gets my adrenalin going , those taxi drivers . 

" We change lanes all the time in Barcelona . 

I 'm used to it and I like to drive fast . "

ATLANTA 0000-00-00 

The defending world champion Atlanta Braves , with the best record and best pitching in baseball , added another weapon Wednesday , acquiring Denny Neagle , the winningest left-hander in the National League , from the Pittsburgh Pirates . 

The Pirates , who conceded earlier this week they would be forced to trim salary from next season 's payroll , received Ron Wright , a first baseman at <OOV> Greenville ; Corey Pointer , a pitcher at Class-A Eugene , and a player to be named . 

It was another stunning mid-season acquisition for the Braves , who already have an <OOV> lead in the National League Eastern Division . 

In the last 00 days , Atlanta has traded for third baseman Terry Pendleton , claimed outfielder Luis Polonia on waivers and called up minor-league phenom Andruw Jones , all in preparation for their fifth post-season .

BERLIN 0000-00-00 

Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey and former champion Linford Christie will run in a " Dream Team " sprint relay squad in honour of Jesse Owens on Friday . 

Johnson , the 000 metres world record holder , and Britain 's 0000 Olympic 000 champion Christie confirmed on Thursday that they would join 000 record holder Bailey and Namibia 's Frankie Fredericks in one of the greatest <OOV> squads ever assembled . 

They will run against quartets from the United States , Europe and Africa in a special race at the Berlin Grand Prix meeting to mark the 00th anniversary of Owens 's four gold medals at the 0000 Olympics in the German capital . 

Christie will run the anchor leg after Canada 's Bailey , American Johnson and Olympic silver medallist Fredericks have run the first three stages of the relay . 

The participation of Bailey and Fredericks had been known before Thursday . 

But Christie did not announce his decision to run until the eve of the meeting when organisers also confirmed Johnson would take part . 

Christie is due to retire from international competition at the end of the season although he may compete for Britain in next season 's European Cup . 

Although Christie , who is not racing the individual 000 metres in Berlin , took his time to agree to run , the veteran was clearly delighted to be part of the tribute to the black American . 

When five former Olympic 000 champions from 0000 to 0000 , who have been invited to watch the race , turned up at a news conference on Thursday , Christie was quick to put his autograph book in front of the them . 

" I do n't normally do this but can you please sign , " he said thrusting an ornate white book in front of Americans Harrison Dillard ( 0000 ) , Lindy <OOV> ( 0000 ) , Jim Hines ( 0000 ) , Trinidad 's <OOV> Crawford ( 0000 ) and Britain 's Allan Wells ( 0000 ) . 

" Jesse Owens inspired everyone here and it is great to have a tribute to him . " 

Owens 's widow Ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out by the sprinter 's grand-daughter Gina Tillman during the meeting 

Berlin organisers hoped to have American 0000 and 0000 champion Carl Lewis in the squad but he injured himself in last Friday 's Brussels meeting .

Nigeria would not refuse Commonwealth officials . 

LAGOS 0000-00-00 

Nigeria would not object to a visit by Commonwealth officials but insists its suspension from the organisation be resolved before any other questions are addressed , Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said on Thursday . 

Ikimi reiterated his position that the Commonwealth had no mandate to send a fact-finding mission . 

" The request I have received is for their officials to come and talk to my officials . 

We cannot object to people wanting to visit Nigeria , " Ikimi told Reuters by telephone from the capital Abuja . 

" The fundamental problem we have with the Commonwealth is our unfair suspension . 

Any discussions we have at ministerial level will be a continuation of what we began in London on that . 

Before that is accomplished we cannot address anything else . " 

Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in November after the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists in defiance of international pleas for clemency . 

A meeting of Commonwealth ministers in London on Wednesday said it planned to send a team of senior officials to Nigeria as soon as possible to persuade Abuja to accept a fact-finding mission .

The latest diplomatic row between Nigeria 's military government and the club of Britain and its former colonies erupted over the terms of a visit by Commonwealth ministers to discuss Nigeria 's suspension .

NATO releases Serb police , crisis easing - NATO . 

SARAJEVO 0000-00-00 

NATO forces released a group of Bosnian Serb policemen late on Thursday and a tense confrontation appeared to be easing , an alliance spokesman said . 

" The situation in Mahala seems to be very much on its way toward resolution . 

My understanding is the ( Serb ) police have been released ... 

In Zvornik , we think the situation is winding down as well , " NATO spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Max Marriner told Reuters . 

NATO troops detained 00 Bosnian Serb policemen early on Thursday after they attacked Moslem refugees returning to homes in Mahala , a Serb-controlled village on Bosnia 's internal boundary line . 

In apparent retaliation for NATO 's detention of the Serbs , an angry Serb mob including policemen trapped six unarmed U.N. police monitors and three local aides in their office in the town of Zvornik , east of Mahala . 

Marriner said NATO forces confiscated 00 <OOV> <OOV> automatic assault rifles from the detained Serbs before setting them free . 

" Local radio and television there ( in Zvornik ) are advising people to step back and take it easy . 

We think that when the word about how things are going in Mahala which is about 00 minutes away by road reaches Zvornik that should help , " Marriner said .

Kornblum , Milosevic discuss election crisis . 

Peter <OOV> 

BELGRADE 0000-00-00 

U.S. envoy John Kornblum met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding Bosnia 's post-war elections . 

The American diplomat arrived in Belgrade two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in Bosnia due to irregularities in the registration of Serb refugee voters . 

" We discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and I made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the Republika Srpska ( Bosnian Serb republic ) which led to this development , " Kornblum said after three hours of talks . 

But he said the United States still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in Bosnia as scheduled on September 00 to bolster the peace process . 

Kornblum gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from Milosevic , the patron of the Bosnian Serbs , to rectify any abuses in the registration process . 

Bosnia 's Moslem political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved . 

Human rights workers say Serbian and Bosnian Serb authorities coerced refugees to register only in Serb-held territory in Bosnia to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest . 

Serbian officials have denied any abuses occurred during a 00-day registration period and the Bosnian Serbs , angry at the postponement of municipal elections , have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community 's blessing . 

Kornblum said only elections endorsed by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) would be legitimate . 

" As we have said publicly before , if there is any effort to do so ( hold local elections ) these elections will not be valid , " he said . " 

The elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the OSCE . " 

After meeting Milosevic , Kornblum flew to the Croatian capital Zagreb . 

He was due to head to the Bosnian town of Banja Luka on Friday to meet Bosnian Serb acting president Biljana Plavsic and Bosnian Serb opposition leaders . 

He also planned to travel to Sarajevo to oversee the formal dissolution of the separatist Croat mini-state in western Bosnia . 

U.N. police , relief workers and NATO officers have reported a rise in political violence across Bosnia in the run-up to the September 00 elections . 

Voters will be choosing a three-member presidency and a parliament to rule over a loose union of Bosnia , comprised of a Serb republic and a Moslem-Croat federation .

<OOV> bickering flared on Wednesday in the troubled western Mexican state of Guerrero as some opposition politicians demanded the army pull out of the area ahead of an upcoming state poll . 

The mayor of <OOV> , a small town some 000 miles ( 000 km ) south of Mexico City , sent a letter to Mexico 's National Human Rights Commission complaining the army 's heavy presence in the town would interfere with the Oct. 0 election .

The arrest came after the ICAC received a complaint that the man had demanded a bribe of HK$ 000,000 ( US$ 00,000 ) to issue a Thai passport , the ICAC said . 

At the time of his arrest , ICAC officers seized HK$ 000,000 , it added . 

The ICAC has kept a close eye on passport scams after a U.S. official was jailed for trafficking fake Honduran passports as part of an immigration racket aimed at Chinese . 

Thai poll shows military wants PM Banharn out . 

BANGKOK 0000-00-00 

Thailand 's powerful military thinks the government is dishonest and Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa 's resignation might solve the nation 's political and economic woes , an opinion poll showed on Thursday . 

Nearly half the 0,000 military personnel surveyed in the <OOV> Institute poll suggested that Banharn resign , while about 00 percent thought he should dissolve parliament and 00 percent thought a cabinet reshuffle could resolve the government 's problems . 

Banharn , who leads a six-party , 00-month-old coalition government , faces a no-confidence debate in parliament next month . 

The prime minister , who has already lost one coalition partner this month , is expected to have a tough battle in the debate because of infighting in his own party and warnings of more pullouts by other coalition partners . 

The poll , conducted earlier this month after Banharn 's coalition completed one year in office , showed the military would prefer General Chatichai Choonhavan -- a former prime minister who was ousted in a military coup in February 0000 -- as prime minister . 

Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh , head of coalition member the New Aspiration Party , was the second choice for prime minister , the poll showed . 

Banharn came in last on the list of proposed leaders with less than one percent of the votes . 

Nearly two-thirds of the people surveyed thought the government was dishonest and insincere , and 00 percent blamed the government 's poor performance for the country 's economic slowdown . 

The opinion of the military in Thailand , which has seen 00 coups or attempted coups since the country switched to parliamentary democracy from absolute monarchy in 0000 , always carries weight in the political scene , despite officials ' vows to distance the military from politics . 

Hamas cleric jailed in Israel hospitalised briefly . 

JERUSALEM 0000-00-00 

Israeli prison officials took jailed Islamic militant Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to hospital briefly on Thursday for medical tests , officials said . 

" This evening Sheikh Yassin completed medical checks and returned to Ramle prisons authority medical centre , " said a spokesman for Israel 's internal security ministry . 

A prison official said Yassin had a mild case of pneumonia . 

The 00-year-old Moslem cleric , jailed by Israel since 0000 , is serving a life sentence for ordering attacks by Hamas guerrillas against Israeli targets . 

The ailing Yassin is the spiritual leader of the fundamentalist Hamas group which has killed scores of Israelis in suicide attacks aimed at wrecking Israel-PLO peace deals . 

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has demanded that Israel release Yassin -- who is confined to a wheelchair -- on humanitarian grounds . 

Israel said last month after it recovered the body of a soldier abducted by Hamas seven years ago that it would consider freeing Yassin .

Scandal hits Clinton campaign at vital moment . 

Michael Conlon 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

President Bill Clinton 's triumphal appearance at the Democratic convention , a vital moment in his bid for a second term , was marred on Thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal . 

Clinton was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his <OOV> re-election campaign when political strategist Dick Morris abruptly announced his resignation on Thursday . 

The tabloid Star magazine reported the married Morris had a lengthy affair with a $ <OOV> prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with Clinton , and with whom he shared White House speeches before they were made . 

" Dick Morris is my friend , and he is a superb political strategist , " Clinton said in a written statement . " 

I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years . " 

Morris declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue . 

The surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some Democrats , who had planned a triumphal celebration of Clinton 's lead over Dole in the opinion polls . 

Senator Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat , called it a " big bump " in the way of the Clinton campaign . 

" It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president , " Feinstein said . 

Clinton was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the Democratic Convention opening at 0 p.m. EDT ( midnight GMT ) . 

The 00-year-old president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing , sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers . 

Republicans hope to seize on the " character " issue to bolster Clinton 's challenger Bob Dole in the final weeks of the campaign . 

Speaking in Santa Barbara , California , Dole did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of Morris , who had advised Clinton to chart a more centrist political course , would make Clinton drift back to the left . 

" Morris has been trying to make President Clinton a Republican , now maybe he 'll revert to the liberal Democrat that he really is , " Dole told reporters . 

Clinton will hit the road on Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first Democratic incumbent re-elected to a second term since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt . 

Aides said Clinton planned to spend most of Thursday in his hotel room several miles ( km ) from the convention hall working on his speech . 

It was apparently neglected on his long " whistle-stop " train trip to the convention , during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country 's heartland . 

He was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest . 

But first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told ABC television , " He 's really fired up . " 

" He wants to outline to the American people what he thinks has been accomplished in the last four years , and what he would like to see done in the next four years , " she said . 

" He 's very excited about this convention ... 

He 's excited about the campaign . 

But more than that , he 's very resolute about what he wants to do . " 

" I do n't take anything for granted . 

I always expect elections to get close . 

I expect to have a great deal of up and down days between now and then , " she said of the November 0 election date . 

Clinton is leading Dole by as much as 00 points according to some polls . 

The campaign pits Dole , a man of quick and withering wit and long-time public service , but stilted speaking style , against the glib and confident Clinton , who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience .

Researchers report progress in muscular dystrophy . 

PHILADELPHIA 0000-00-00 

University of Pennsylvania researchers on Thursday said a new <OOV> technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals . 

Word of the findings , to be published in the Oct. 0 issue of the journal " Human Gene Therapy , " came in advance of the annual Jerry Lewis Labour Day weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research . 

Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials . 

Nevertheless , " a treatment based on the new strategy .... may have the potential to benefit many patients , " the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre said in a release . 

Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat . 

Death strikes in early adulthood . 

Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin . 

In the study at the University 's Institute for Human Gene Therapy , researchers altered a <OOV> virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene . 

The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes . 

In the experiment , between 00 to 00 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing . 

Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said . 

The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .

<OOV> ad index fell in July . 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

The help-wanted advertising index fell in July , the Conference Board said Thursday , reflecting the uneven nature of the nation 's labour markets . 

The monthly index fell to 00.0 in July against a reading of 00.0 in June , the private business research group said . 

In July , the volume of help-wanted advertising fell in five of the nine U.S. regions . 

" The labour market has been expanding throughout 0000 , but in a very uneven pattern , " Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said . " 

Recent <OOV> figures indicate that conservative hiring plans are keeping job growth below the rate of overall economic activity . " 

With 0.0 percent gross domestic product growth expected for 0000 , new job growth should slowly lower the unemployment rate over the rest of the year . 

" With the unemployment rate staying close to about 0.0 percent over the last two years , there is a good chance the rate will slowly drop to about 0.0 percent by the end of the year , " Goldstein said . 

The July index matched the reading for July , 0000 . 

The greatest declines in the volume of help-wanted advertising were in the New England , Mountain and West South Central regions . 

The greatest increase was in the East North Central region . 

Police seek suspects in Atlantic City jewel heist . 

ATLANTIC CITY , N.J. 0000-00-00 

Atlantic City police said Thursday they were seeking two men and two women in connection with a $ 000,000 theft of jewelry and cash from a guest of the Showboat Hotel and Casino . 

Capt . 

Richard Andrews said police were seeking a man shown on a hotel videotape carrying a suitcase resembling the victim 's . " 

We want to talk to him , " Andrews said of the man . 

A second man and two women also were being sought .

O.J. Simpson hints at more supporting evidence . 

Jackie Frank 

WASHINGTON 0000-00-00 

O.J. Simpson said on Thursday he was financially broken by his defence against murder charges but he was hopeful new evidence to support him would be available for a civil trial next month . 

The former football star was found not guilty by a criminal trial jury last October of the murders of his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Goldman , in June 0000 . 

He now faces a civil suit brought by families of the victims who hold him responsible for the deaths . 

He told reporters a court order not to talk about his case kept him from detailing how he has fulfilled his pledge to find the killers . 

But he added without elaborating , " hopefully we will see some things come out in this next trial . " 

The judge in the civil trial has imposed a sweeping gag order that prohibits lawyers , witnesses and parties to the case from discussing it with the media or elsewhere in public . 

" I would love to speak about everything , " said Simpson , who vowed after his acquittal to find the killers and offered a substantial reward . 

His lawyers have said his defence in the civil trial that starts Sept . 

00 will be that he did not kill the victims . 

Simpson said at the hotel news conference his plans include eventually writing another book . 

He added that he has had job offers but more have come from abroad than at home . 

" I 'm broke . 

I am not crying the blues . 

I can get along just fine , " he said . " 

Whatever you want to send me , I need . " 

He again accused the news media of erroneous reporting on his case but did not signal any plans for lawsuits as he did on Wednesday in an address at a jam-packed Washington church . 

Contrary to news reports , Simpson said , he has received support from both blacks and whites . 

He again dismissed charges that he had distanced himself from the black community during his successful football and commercial career , only to seek their support after he faced murder charges . 

A crowd of 0,000 paid $ 00 a head to hear the former star running back for the Buffalo Bills professional football club and a Football Hall of Fame member on Wednesday night . 

The crowd in the church was wildly supportive , showering Simpson with gifts and praise . 

But outside , dozens of protesters from the D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence called for the church to support victims of violence instead . 

Clinton adviser Morris announces resignation . 

CHICAGO 0000-00-00 

President Bill Clinton 's top political strategist Dick Morris resigned on Thursday , saying he did not want to become an issue in Clinton 's re-election campaign . 

In a written statement , distributed by the Clinton campaign , Morris avoided comment on published allegations that he had engaged in a year-long affair with a $ <OOV> prostitute . 

The statement from Morris said that he had submitted his resignation on Wednesday night . " 

While I served I sought to avoid the limelight because I did not want to become the message . 

Now , I resign so I will not become the issue , " he said . 

The announcement followed a report in the weekly supermarket tabloid Star magazine , reprinted in Thursday 's editions of the New York Post , that the married adviser had hired a 00-year-old prostitute on a weekly basis while visiting Washington to advise Clinton on his re-election campaign . 

" I will not subject my wife , family or friends to the sadistic , vitriol of yellow journalism . 

I will not dignify such journalism with a reply or an answer . 

I never will , " his statement said . 

It was distributed to reporters at the press centre of Clinton 's Democratic convention headquarters just hours before the president was to address the delegates accepting the party 's nomination for a second four-year term in the White House . 

U.S. surgeon investigated for discarding foot . 

CHARLESTON , S.C. 0000-00-00 

Health officials said on Thursday they were investigating the discovery of an amputated foot on a beach near Charleston to determine whether a local surgeon had improperly disposed of infectious waste . 

The foot , which washed up on Sullivan 's Island beach this month , was amputated three years ago from a child whose legs were deformed . 

The foot had to be removed so the infant could be fitted with a prosthesis . 

An orthopedic surgeon was given permission by the child 's parents and the hospital to keep the foot for research and educational purposes . 

Health officials said the surgeon told authorities he stored the foot in his freezer at home , but the freezer recently broke down and the contents spoiled . 

The surgeon , who apologised for the incident , said he decided to put the foot in a crab trap to remove the flesh . 

The foot later washed up on the beach .

EU barley sale worth $ 000 / T , for Saudi - sources . 

PARIS 0000-00-00 

A European Union sale of 000,000 tonnes of German intervention barley is worth some $ 000 per tonne fob Germany and is mostly destined for Saudi Arabia , European grain sources said on Thursday . 

The EU 's cereals management committee sold 000,000 tonnes of German intervention barley at a minimum price of 000.00 Ecus per tonne . 

Saudi Arabia provisionally bought 000,000 tonnes of <OOV> barley at an August 00 tender at prices between $ 000 and $ 000 including cost , insurance and freight , traders said last week . 

But European grain traders and officials said the Saudis might reduce the purchase to 000,000 tonnes . 

Traders have said a substantial part of the deal was likely to come from the European Union , which enjoys a supply and freight advantage over other producers . 

But subtracting freight costs , the equivalent fob price of the deal is around $ 000 , well below the $ 000 per tonne floor price which the EU put on its barley as news of the deal emerged last week . 

Last Thursday the EU sold 00,000 tonnes of German intervention barley at a minimum price of 000.00 Ecus per tonne , which was seen as worth $ 000 per tonne fob .

<OOV> Edison sees 0 power lines back today . 

NEW YORK 0000-00-00 

Southern California Edison Co said it expected two 000 kilovolt ( KV ) power lines in southern California to resume service later today after being shut late Wednesday because of a wildfire raging north of Los Angeles . 

" They are expected to be placed in service later today , " said company spokesman Steve Conroy , adding repair crews have been removing smoke and other fire-related residues , which had settled on the two lines . 

The shutdown of the 000 KV lines reduced by 000 megawatts ( MW ) the amount of power which the area received from <OOV> Edison 's 0,000 MW Sierra hydroelectric facility , he said . 

Conroy noted two 000 KV and another 000 KV line running from the Sierra plant to Los Angeles remained in operation , and continued to carry some of the production from Sierra to the region . 

On Monday , the two 000 KV transmission cables were taken out of service , also for cleaning , for about a day . 

Containment of the fire has been difficult because of the hot , arid , windy weather in the region , Conroy said . 

" The fires keep moving back because of the winds , " he said , forcing the utility to shut those transmission lines for a second time this week . 

Local authorities charged a teenager for starting the blaze . 

In four days , the fire destroyed 00,000 acres of forest land .

Sierra Semiconductor jumps on exit plan . 

Martin <OOV> 

SEATTLE 0000-00-00 

Sierra Semiconductor Corp jumped 00 percent Thursday on the expectation the company would emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after its planned exit from the computer modem business . 

The San Jose , Calif. , company was up 0-0/0 at 00-0/0 after its announcement Wednesday that it planned to pull out of the highly competitive <OOV> business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment . 

" Certainly the company will be a much smaller company now , but it will be a more profitable business , " said analyst Elias Moosa of Roberston Stephens & Co . 

But analysts noted that Sierra still has much painful work ahead of it , including cutting as many as 000 jobs from its workforce , which currently has 000 people , and building up the business of its <OOV> unit , which makes routing devices and chipsets for high-speed computer networks . 

The company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of $ 00 million to $ 00 million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments . 

Scott Randall of Soundview Financial Group said the company likely would have difficulty selling its <OOV> business . 

" Once you announce your intention to exit a business , it becomes a complete buyer 's market , " he said . 

And he said that while the company is focusing on the fastest-growing part of its business , the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of much-larger players such as International Business Machines Corp . 

" As the market develops the question is , are they able to make that transition to be a much larger company ? " 

Randall said . 

Other analysts were more bullish , even though the company is expected to shrink to slightly more than half its current size in sales . 

" It 's a positive strategic move , " said Miles Kan of Hambrecht & Quist . 

" The modem business is a <OOV> , commodity business , " he said . 

The company 's <OOV> unit generated $ 00 million of the company 's $ 000 million in sales in the first half of the year , compared with $ 00 million in sales of modem chips , Kan said . 

But the PMC unit is far more profitable , he said . 

Sierra 's stock has fallen from a high of nearly $ 00 this year as the computer chip sector has been battered by falling prices and concern about slowing demand .

LONDON 0000-00-00 

Liam Gallagher , singer of Britain 's top rock group Oasis , flew out on Thursday to join the band three days after the start of its U.S. tour . 

Gallagher made his usual obscene gestures and swore at journalists as he prepared to fly from London 's Heathrow airport to Chicago . 

" I hate you <OOV> ing lot , yet you 're always asking me too many things . 

I 'm not a supermodel you know , " he said . 

On Monday , just 00 minutes before his flight was due to depart , Liam decided not to travel with the rest of the group , which includes his brother Noel . 

Liam caught a taxi back to London saying he had " problems at home " . 

He was believed to be suffering from laryngitis and said he had to go house-hunting with actress girlfriend Patsy Kensit . 

When they first heard that Liam had not flown out with the band at the start of the tour , many U.S. fans asked for refunds on their concert tickets . 

The group began the U.S. tour , which is scheduled to last until September 00 , with a concert in Chicago on Tuesday at which Noel Gallagher filled in for his brother as lead singer . 

Slough Estates helps lift property sector . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

A strong set of interim results and an upbeat outlook from Slough Estates Plc helped to boost the property sector on Thursday . 

Shares in Slough , which earlier announced a 00 percent rise in first-half pretax profit to 00.0 million stg , climbed nearly six percent , or <OOV> to 000 pence at 0000 GMT , while British Land added 00-0 / <OOV> to <OOV> , Land Securities rose 0-0 / <OOV> to <OOV> and <OOV> was <OOV> higher at 000 . 

Traders said positive comment from investment banks Merrill Lynch and SBC Warburg also fueled the gains . 

One dealer said positive stances from Merrill Lynch and SBC Warburg were the key factors behind the gains . 

A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said the bank was preparing to issue a note on the sector . " 

We have been very positive ( on property ) , " he said , adding : " On a technical basis it is our most favoured sector . " 

SBC Warburg issued an update on the property sector on Thursday , saying that most of the predictions it made at the start of the year were being realised . 

" In the property market it is a case of so far , so good , " a member of SBC Warburg 's property team said . 

SBC Warburg said it is maintaining its forecast for five percent growth in rental incomes during 0000 , but it has shaved its forecast for capital growth to five percent from six . 

The spokesman said SBC Warburg has also put an " add " recommendation on Slough Estates ' shares , but added that this " is a general move , not because of the results . " 

Slough 's chairman Sir Nigel <OOV> added to the bullish mood in the sector , saying in a statement that " with the prospect of a period of steady economic growth and low inflation ahead , there is good reason to believe that the property sector should continue its improvement . "

Jordanian PM Kabariti meets Arafat in West Bank . 

RAMALLAH , West Bank 0000-00-00 

Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti began talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank on Thursday on the stalled Middle East peace process , officials said . 

Kabariti flew by helicopter to Palestinian-ruled Ramallah and after a brief arrival ceremony went into talks with Arafat . 

The prime minister 's visit , his first trip outside the country since Jordan was shaken by food riots earlier this month , came against the backdrop of a Palestinian general strike in the West Bank and Gaza . 

Arafat called the four-hour strike , which ended at noon ( 0000 GMT ) to protest against Israeli policy on settlements and Jerusalem . 

Jordan 's official state news agency Petra said Kabariti would hold discussions " on the latest developments in the peace process and bilateral cooperation " . 

Iran says five spy networks destroyed , 00 held . 

TEHRAN 0000-00-00 

Iranian security forces have broken up five espionage rings in northwestern Iran and arrested 00 people on charges of spying for unnamed countries , a daily newspaper said on Thursday . 

Jomhuri Eslami quoted the West Azerbaijan province security chief as saying those held confessed to gathering confidential information , photographing strategic sites , doing propaganda against state officials and " spreading pan-Turkism " . 

It was not clear if they were the same five spy rings , allegedly led by Turkish diplomats , that Iran said in April it had broken up in the same area , which borders Turkey . 

The April arrests were announced shortly after a row in which Tehran asked Ankara to withdraw four Turkish diplomats accused of spying , and Turkey expelled four Iranian diplomats for their alleged links to killings of Iranian exiles . 

Ties between the two neighbours , strained also over a military accord between Turkey and Israel which drew strong Iranian objections , have improved since Islamist Necmettin Erbakan took over as Turkish prime minister in June . 

The daily Iran on Thursday quoted Intelligence Minister Ali <OOV> as saying agents arrested 000 people for allegedly spying for Iraq , the United States and other unnamed countries in the Iranian year which ended on March 00 . 

Mideast Gulf oil outlook - India holds the key . 

DUBAI 0000-00-00 

India will continue to hold the key to the middle distillates product market in the Middle East Gulf in the short term , traders in the region said on Thursday . 

They said premiums on high quality jet kerosene have widened to around $ 0 , and are likely to remain strong in the near term . 

" On the jet kerosene side we must be cautious about quality . 

Some are commanding a very good premium of 00 cents to one dollar . 

It 's been 00 cents to Korea . 

This will stay at this sort of price premium for a while , " one said . 

" But for normal jet the weakened demand is quite noticeable , the premium is around 00-00 cents . 

The differential is not normally as wide as this , " he added . 

Another put the premium for jet kerosene at between 00 and 00 cents . 

One trader said despite the fact that some kerosene was in storage at Dubai ports , demand looked to exceed supply in the near term . 

Jet kerosene was assessed at $ 00.00 - $ 00.00 a barrel fob Gulf on Thursday , up from $ 00.00 last week . 

Dealers expected premiums to stick around current levels for the next two or three weeks , before they get a boost in the second half of September from demand for October cargoes . 

Gas oil , assessed at $ 00.00 - $ 00.00 a barrel fob Gulf , was little changed on Thursday from last week 's $ 00.00 - $ 00.00 . 

" On gas oil , in the near term demand and supply are balanced to a bit short , there are some enquiries into east Africa and short covering in India , " said one trader . 

" The Indians have awarded three cargoes , but the question is whether they will come out for more , " he added . 

India has acquired 000,000 tonnes of diesel in three cargoes , bound for the west coast , in its October tender . 

Traders said the award could be India 's lowest in recent years . 

" After IOC 's very small purchase of 000,000 tonnes , I 'm still suspicious that they will buy more in the second half of October , " another said . 

But traders see the market remaining tight in the short-term , with some surplus arising closer to October . 

" I see an overhang of gas oil further out , " one said . 

" Gas oil will remain tight in the short term up to mid-September with the premium of around $ 0 for 0.0 percent ( sulphur material ) . 

In the second half of September and October we see the premium coming off to 00-00 cents . " 

Traders said there was not much demand for one percent sulphur material gas oil , with the premium at 00 to 00 cents . 

Egypt police catch ancient manuscript thieves . 

CAIRO 0000-00-00 

Egyptian police have arrested eight people who were trying to sell an ancient copy of the Old Testament , the official al-Akhbar newspaper said on Thursday . 

The daily said the men had wanted to sell the undated manuscript to a Jewish group for five million pounds ( $ 0.0 million ) . 

Instead an undercover police officer pretended to be interested in buying it and arrested them . 

The newspaper did not give any details about the manuscript but said it had been relinquished to the Islamic Museum in Cairo .

DUBAI 0000-00-00

Palestinians end four-hour strike .

Baker made secret trip to Syria in March 0000 . 

WASHINGTON 0000-00-00 

Former Secretary of State James Baker made a secret trip to Syria in March 0000 in an unsuccessful bid to break an impasse in negotiations between Syria and Israel , the Washington Post reported on Thursday . 

The paper said Baker declined to discuss the trip , but authorised an associate to confirm it took place and give an account of it . 

News of the secret trip came after Baker trashed the Clinton administration at the Republican National Convention two weeks ago for its efforts to nudge Syria into peace with Israel .

FEATURE - Rich new detail on U.S. Civil War unearthed .

WASHINGTON 0000-00-00 

A freed black man writes to his <OOV> wife , a mother pleads with Abraham Lincoln on behalf of her son and a maimed soldier poses for an official photograph in newly reopened records that bring the U.S. Civil War back to life . 

Working in the basement of the National Archives , members of the Civil War Conservation Corps are organising the military records of volunteers who fought for the North so that they can be preserved on microfilm . 

The faded documents have been stowed away in the Archives since it opened in 0000 and have rarely seen the light of day . 

Each soldier 's file is a gold mine of information : enlistment papers , muster rolls , medical records , discharge certificates , letters and photographs . 

Since the project began almost two years ago , corps volunteers have focused on African American troops , preparing records in time for the unveiling in Washington this year of a special memorial to black soldiers who fought in the war . 

More than 000,000 black soldiers fought and 00,000 died . 

In one letter , a black soldier heading South wrote his wife , " though great is the present national difficulties yet I look forward to a brighter day when I shall have the oportunity of seeing you in the full enjoyment of freedom . 

" I would like to no ( sic ) if you are still in slavery if you are , it will not be long before we shall have crushed the system that now <OOV> you for in the course of three months you shall have your liberty . 

Great is the outpouring of the coloured people that is now rallying with the heart of lions against the very curse that has separated you and me . " 

In another letter dated January 0000 , a well-to-do Washington matron wrote to Lincoln to plead for her son , who faced a dishonourable discharge from the Army . " 

James is a prisoner for a thoughtless act of folly , while those who have done nothing for the cause are free , " she wrote . 

Lincoln 's <OOV> on the letter read : " If his colonel will say in writing on this sheet he is willing to receive this man back to the regiment , I will pardon and send him . " 

The soldier was subsequently pardoned . 

While the letters speak to the anguish of separation , a photograph of a black amputee speaks to the terrible physical cost of the war . 

In a picture required for his military discharge , Pvt . 

Lewis Martin , with haunted eyes , posed bare-chested to reveal his missing arm and leg , blown off during a battle at Petersburg , Virginia , in July 0000 . 

The work on black troops has provided new insight into the rhythms of plantation talk and culture , said John Simon , professor of history at Southern Illinois University at <OOV> and editor of Gen . 

Ulysses Grant 's papers . 

" These ( writings ) are not only poetic but a linguistic treasure trove . 

This is the first generation of African Americans that really can express itself without fear and punishment , " Simon said . 

" I think there 's probably a whole lot of material that would expand our understanding of the sociology of the war , " said Edward Smith , director of American Studies at American University in Washington . 

The war between the North and South raged for nearly four years , claimed the lives of half a million Americans and forever seared the nation 's consciousness . 

Southern records have already been preserved . 

They were put on microfilm about 00 years ago through a grant from the United Daughters of the <OOV> . 

The Civil War Conservation Corps is mostly retirees joined by students during the school year . 

Director Budge <OOV> , who has shepherded the project from the beginning , predicts it will take up to a decade to complete . 

The work was inspired by a National Park Service plan to put computer databases at Civil War battlefields across the country so that Americans might research their ancestors . 

The records also provide insight into medical thinking of the day . 

One soldier was discharged because of " mental incapacity and <OOV> ( sic ) of the brain , alleged by the Patient to be connected with a fall on the head but believed to arise from long continued and excessive masturbation . "

New bomb attacks on Corsica despite crackdown vow . 

Sylvie Florence 

AJACCIO , Corsica 0000-00-00 

Separatist guerrillas planted two bombs overnight at government offices on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica despite fresh warnings of a crackdown by Paris , police said on Thursday . 

In the latest in a wave of attacks , a two kg ( four lb ) bomb seriously damaged two floors of Agriculture Ministry offices located just 00 metres ( yards ) from a police station in the centre of the island capital Ajaccio . 

No one was hurt . 

A second device , packed with five kg ( 00 lbs ) of explosive , was defused before it could go off , police said . 

The new attacks followed by a day a warning of a new " get-tough " policy by Paris toward the separatists , who seek greater autonomy . 

Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre , under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups , told the daily La Corse in a statement he had given " firm orders " to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice . 

Judges on the island had accused Paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widely-reported talks with separatists which have now failed . 

The latest bombing , close on the heels of the new orders , brought charges that police were powerless . 

" No searches , no arrests , no police reinforcements visible on the island , despite the ministry 's promises , " the daily France-Soir lamented . 

" On the island , as at the Place <OOV> ( the Interior Ministry 's Paris address ) , people are well aware who is who and who is doing what . 

It is time to end this nightly farce , " said the pro-government daily Le Figaro in an editorial . 

No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday 's incidents , which brought to 00 the number of guerrilla attacks on the resort island since mid-August , when separatist guerrillas ended a shaky seven-month truce . 

Corsica has been racked by low-level <OOV> violence , principally directed against government targets , for two decades . 

The daily Le Monde reported on Wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the French mainland on the principle that " 000 grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than 000 kilos in Corsica " . 

The newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government . 

Sweden 's OM to open London forest products bourse . 

STOCKHOLM 0000-00-00 

Swedish options and derivatives exchange OM Gruppen AB said on Thursday it would open an electronic bourse for forest industry products in London in the first half of 0000 . 

" Together with subsidiaries <OOV> , the London Securities & Derivatives Exchange and OM Stockholm , OM Gruppen will open an international electronic bourse for forest products in the first half of 0000 , " OM Gruppen said in a statement . 

The first commodity to be traded on the PULPEX bourse will be pulp , but OM said trade would be extended to include products such as timber , recycled paper and other paper qualities . 

" Through the establishment of PULPEX , London will have a commodities bourse for forest products which complements existing bourses for oil , metals and ' <OOV> ' ( coffee , sugar and cocoa ) , " OM said . 

PULPEX was the result of a three-year project run in cooperation between OM and representatives of the forest industry , the company said . 

Huge swings in the price of pulp over the past few years have made pulp producers ' profitability unpredictable , and made investing in new production capacity a risky business . 

" Without the ability to hedge prices , changes in the world market price for pulp has had an immediate impact on players ' profitability , " OM said . 

It said global production of pulp amounted to around 000 million tonnes per year , of which around 00 percent or 00 million tonnes was sold on the spot market . 

At current prices , the value of this production was around $ 00 billion . 

PULPEX will be both a marketplace and a clearing house , OM said , adding that the British Securities and Investments Board had been informed of OM 's plans . 

PULPEX 's clearing operation will be covered by the parent company guarantee issued by OM Gruppen to its wholly-owned bourses and clearing organisations .

Italian Police said on Thursday they had arrested five people in connection with the slaying of the daughter and 00-year-old nephew of a Mafia boss earlier this week . 

Santa Puglisi , 00 , and Salvatore Botta were gunned down in a cemetery in this eastern Sicilian city on Tuesday in a crime which shocked even hardened anti-Mafia investigators .

They wanted to get a weight off their consciences , " a police spokesman said . 

He added the couple had also shed light on the murder last year of the wife of Mafia boss Nitto Santapaola . 

Puglisi was shot as she knelt praying by the tomb of her young husband , who was himself killed last year in a Mafia ambush . 

Botta , who had accompanied Puglisi to the cemetary , tried to flee the lone gunman but was caught and killed .

Bodies have been sighted but no survivors have yet been found at the site of Thursday 's crash of a Russian airliner on Norway 's remote Arctic island of Spitzbergen , Norwegian officials said . 

" We have found dead people , " said Rune Hansen , the island 's deputy governor , told Norwegian television . 

The Norwegian news agency NTB quoted another official on the island as saying no survivors had been found . 

The Vnukovo Airlines Tupolev 000 flight from Moscow , carrying 000 passengers and a crew of 00 , crashed in bad weather 00 km ( six miles ) east of Longyearbyen , the island 's only airstrip , officials said . 

First rescuers arrived shortly after 0 p.m. ( 0000 GMT ) and reported soon afterwards that most of the three-engine jet 's wreckage was scattered around the top of the small Opera mountain while the rest had slid down the mountainside . 

Air traffic officials said they had lost contact with the flight , scheduled to arrive at around 00.00 a.m. ( 0000 GMT ) , shortly before it was due to land .

<OOV> winds and heavy rains batter Belgium . 

BRUSSELS 0000-00-00 

Torrential rains and <OOV> winds battered Belgium on Thursday causing widespread damage as some areas had more rainfall in 00 hours than they normally get in a month , the meteorological office said . 

Cellars were flooded , trees uprooted and roofs damaged , but there were no reports of any injuries , an interior affairs ministry spokesman said . 

Some trains were delayed as fallen trees blocked lines . 

Brussels received 0.0 cm ( 0.00 inches ) of water in the past 00 hours -- compared to an average 0.0 cm ( 0.00 inches ) per month -- but in several communes in the south of the country up to 0 cm ( 0.0 inches ) fell , the Royal Meteorological Institute ( RMT ) said . 

The RMT spokesman said that near the eastern city of Turnhout , a group of boy scouts camping in a low-lying meadow had to be evacuated as water flooded their tents . 

The rain also severely hindered Belgian investigators ' excavations in the southern village of Jumet , where they are looking for bodies in one of the houses of the main character in a paedophile <OOV> scandal . 

But the coastal towns got off lightly as the flooding that had been expected due to a combination of spring tides and high winds failed to materialise .

HELSINKI 0000-00-00 

Finnish police said on Thursday they had arrested two men suspected of sexually abusing a captive 00-year-old girl , but did not believe the case was linked to others in Europe . 

The men , both Finns aged about 00 , were arrested last Saturday in the western town of Tampere in a raid on a luxury boat owned by one of them . 

The girl was being held on the boat and had sought help from a passer-by , police chief inspector Ilkka <OOV> said .

The girl was taken to hospital .

Witnesses had reported seeing many young women and some girls who looked clearly underage at parties around the boat in recent weeks , the daily newspaper <OOV> said .

<OOV> untroubled by margin pressure . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

The chairman of British-based components and engineering group T&N Plc said on Thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets . 

In an interview following its first-half results , which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past , Sir Colin Hope said T&N had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets . 

Looking at market prospects , he said : " I think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably <OOV> along in the rather mixed way it 's been in the first half . " 

" It 's very difficult to predict the market ( trend ) this year . 

It could be better , or it could be worse , " Hope added , echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries . 

" You can see anxieties in Germany and France , in particular , beginning to grow and develop . 

America , however , is looking a little better , " he said . 

Compared with the end of last year , when T&N predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in 0000 , Hope said : " I think the difference ( now ) is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be , but equally we 're certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half . " 

Against this background , Hope said the group was glad it had rationalised and <OOV> even though this had pressed margins , which had slipped to 0.0 percent from 00.0 percent a year ago . 

" I think the figure of 0.0 percent on the first half , when you consider the fact that we 've been destocking , the fairly mixed customer demand , and the fact that we sold the ( southern African ) mines actually is not bad . 

" It does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over 00 percent again , " he added , saying : " We continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average 00 percent profit margins over the cycle . " 

" We 've always taken the view that we are the sort of company that 's quite capable of working in difficult circumstances -- we 're rather used to it . 

And we feel very confident that we 're doing all the right things , " Hope said . 

" When the ( profit ) figures will bounce back up again is just a function of markets recovering just a fraction , " he added . 

Commenting on the continued struggle to get control of German piston maker <OOV> , which has been hampered by regulatory obstacles , Hope said T&N 's confidence " continues to improve " that it may eventually be able to proceed .

Earthquake jolts New Zealands South Island . 

WELLINGTON 0000-00-00 

An earthquake measuring 0.0 on the Richter scale shook New Zealands upper South Island on Thursday but there were no reports of injuries , Television New Zealand said . 

It said the quake , centred near the small town of <OOV> , was strongly felt in the cities of Nelson and Christchurch . 

Some minor damage had been reported in the spa town of <OOV> . 

New Zealand is prone to frequent earthquakes but they rarely cause major damage . 

The country has only 0.0 million people in an area about the size of Britain or Japan . 

Hong Kong 's Tsang sees growth , smooth transition . 

Mark <OOV> 

WELLINGTON 0000-00-00 

Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said on Thursday he expected the territory 's economy to keep growing at around five percent but with some fluctuations from year to year . 

Tsang , who made the remarks during a visit to New Zealand , also spoke strongly in favour of keeping the Hong Kong dollar pegged to its U.S. counterpart , and said negotiations with China on next year 's budget were going smoothly . 

Hong Kong 's economy grew by only 0.0 percent in the first quarter , down from 0.0 percent a year earlier , and some private sector economists have revised downwards their predictions for the 0000 year . 

Second quarter growth estimates will be released when the Hong Kong government issues its half-yearly economic report on Friday . 

" Our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid , " Tsang told a news conference after meeting New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch . 

" There will be fluctuations in individual years , but it wo n't be a big margin , " he said . 

He said inflation was under control and the Hong Kong dollar was " rock solid " . 

Its link to the U.S. dollar had proved an engine of growth for the past 00 years . 

" There 's absolutely no economic or financial or political reason for us to change . 

A lot of investment in Hong Kong , some of which ( is ) by China , is predicated on the link continuing . " 

Britain will hand over Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 00 , 0000 . 

Tsang said three sets of meetings with Chinese authorities on Hong Kong 's 0000-00 budget , which will span the transition period , had gone smoothly . " 

None of our basic precepts have been challenged . " 

Hong Kong will retain its own currency after the handover , run its own financial and monetary policy and have control over its own foreign exchange reserves . 

It will have no duty to contribute any taxes to Beijing , Tsang said . 

He described the condition of the property market as " very good indeed " . 

" You know , we went through a little climb and a little trough over the last few years . 

Because of speculation in the market we introduced certain measures , but they are not draconian measures , and we brought it down to earth . " 

Tsang said the market would continue to appreciate because property and land were scarce . 

The government would put land on the market to stop rentals " going through the roof " , but this would mean reclamation , with possible environmental problems . 

" There will be on the whole a slightly upward climb , consistent with our economic growth rate , " he said in reference to the property market . 

Tsang , the third senior figure in the government after the governor and chief secretary , said his stated aim was to serve as financial secretary for two years under British rule and three years under China . 

Taiwan dollar ends higher , narrow trade seen . 

TAIPEI 0000-00-00 

The Taiwan dollar closed slightly firmer on Thursday amid tight Taiwan dollar liquidity in the banking system , and dealers said the rate was likely to move narrowly in the near term . 

The Taiwan dollar fell in early trade on month-end U.S. dollar demand , but the downtrend was later reversed as Taiwan dollar liquidity tightened . " 

Banks do not want to hold big U.S. dollar positions at this moment , " said one dealer , adding that the rate was likely to hover around current levels .

Indonesia plays down U.S. consulate attack . 

JAKARTA 0000-00-00 

Indonesia sought on Thursday to play down a fire bomb attack on a U.S. consulate earlier this week , saying it was being treated as a criminal rather than a political act , the official Antara news agency said . 

The police are still investigating the incident . 

It is evident the happening is not politically motivated but just an ordinary criminal act , the news agency quoted East Java military commander Major-General Utomo as saying . 

The Tuesday morning attack on the consulate in Indonesias second largest city of Surabaya , caused slight damage to a guard house before being quickly extinguished , a spokesman at the U.S. embassy in Jakarta , 000 km ( 000 miles ) west of Surabaya , said on Wednesday . 

No one was injures , he said . 

Nobody should try and exaggerate it by calling it a bomb because it was just a molotov cocktail , Utomo said . 

He said police were investigating the incident and patrols around diplomatic offices in Surabaya would be stepped up .

HK civil servants contest ban on China panel . 

HONG KONG 0000-00-00 

Senior Hong Kong civil servants were given the go-ahead on Thursday to challenge a government ban on them standing for the Beijing-backed panel to choose the territory 's first post-handover leader and lawmakers . 

The Supreme Court ruled that a judicial hearing contesting the ban would be heard on September 00 , three days before the nomination period for the Selection Committee closes . 

The government maintains the ban , announced earlier this month , is necessary to avoid a possible conflict of interest because civil servants are involved in determining government policy . 

Civil servants argue the ban stymies their political rights . 

The <OOV> Selection Committee will select Hong Kong 's future chief executive to replace the British governor and a provisional legislature to take over from the elected chamber which Beijing plans to dissolve . 

Hong Kong , a British colony for more than 000 years , will be handed back to China at midnight on June 00 next year . 

China intends to dismantle the territory 's first fully-elected legislature because it opposes Britain 's recent electoral reforms and install an interim appointed chamber , a decision that has generated considerable controversy . 

The judicial review sought by <OOV> bureaucrats will apply to only about 0,000 of the approximately 00,000 civil servants affected . 

Police unions are not contesting the ban , which affects all 00,000 officers , and nor are the very top tier of Hong Kong 's mandarin class , the policy secretaries . 

More than 00,000 application forms for places on the Selection Committee have been handed out since the nomination period opened . 

It closes on September 00 . 

Singapore Refining Company expected to shut CDU 0 . 

SINGAPORE 0000-00-00 

Singapore Refining Company ( SRC ) is expected to shutdown its 00,000 barrel-per-day ( bpd ) crude distillation unit ( CDU ) in September , an industry source said on Thursday . 

" They think something is stuck , " the source said . " 

But nothing has been decided as they are still waiting for an X-ray machine to determine the problem . " 

The source said the problem was discovered during the past month during which time CDU No.0 's production has varied from maximum capacity of 00,000 bpd to as low as 00,000 bpd , depending on the crude being run . 

" We are having a lot of problems , " said a source . 

An earlier problem with CDU No . 

0 arose on July 00 when an industry source said the CDU would be closed down briefly in August for repairs to a heat exchanger . 

But by mid-August , a company spokesman said repairs had been carried out without any shutdown . 

The 000,000 bpd SRC refinery is co-owned by the Singapore Petroleum Company , British Petrolem and Caltex , the joint-venture of U.S. majors Chevron Corp and Texaco Inc .

Lenzing expects negative results in H0 . 

VIENNA 0000-00-00 

Austrian viscose fibre maker Lenzing AG said on Thursday it expected to post negative group results in the second half of the year after posting losses in the first six months . 

" A preview of the second half of 0000 does not reveal any signs of a significant improvement in market conditions , " Lenzing said in a statement released ahead of its earnings conference . 

For the first six months of the year , Lenzing said it posted a group pre-tax loss of 00.0 million schillings from a profit of 000 million in the year-ago period . 

The group attributed the first-half losses to weak demand and falling prices of viscose fibres , as well as sluggish economies in the West .

Algeria faults Britain over Islamists gathering . 

PARIS 0000-00-00 

Algeria , fighting a vicious war against Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas , attacked Britain on Wednesday for allowing Islamist groups to meet in London . 

The Islamist gathering , due to be held in London on September 0 , has triggered concern and anger in several other Arab countries like Egypt which is also fighting armed Moslem fundamentalists . 

British Jewish groups have also voiced protest because they said Palestinian Islamist Hamas as well as the banned Algerian Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) are among those radical Islamists attending the conference . 

A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement read on Algerian television that Algeria " has received with concern the information over a meeting of terrorist groups working against the interests of the Arab and Islamic world . " 

" Algeria expresses its sharp rejection of a meeting putting together masterminds and ideologists and financers of terrorism , " the spokesman said , adding the Algerian government has asked the British embassy in Algiers for clarifications . 

The Algerian ambassador in London has also asked for clarification from the Foreign Office over the meeting of Islamist groups . 

Algeria said " they are clearly working to undermine the stability " of Arab countries . 

British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday from Pakistan his government would only take action against the planned Islamists gathering in London if British law was broken . 

" People who wish to hold conferences of course do n't need to seek permission from the government in Britain , " he said . 

An estimated 00,000 people , including more than 000 foreigners , have been killed in Algeria 's violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early 0000 when authorities in Algeria cancelled a general election in which FIS had taken a commanding lead .

Wall Street ponders Rubin 's role if Clinton wins . 

Donna Sells 

NEW YORK 

The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected . 

Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar . 

Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week . 

Should Rubin leave , Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him . 

Rubin 's predecessor at the Treasury , Lloyd Bentsen , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan . 

" Obviously , under the Clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , " said Chris <OOV> , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. " Under Rubin , the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar . " 

That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from <OOV> World War lows of 0.0000 German marks on March 0 , 0000 , and 00.00 Japanese yen on April 00 , 0000 . 

Currently , the dollar stands at about 0.00 marks and 000 yen . 

Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 00 years on Wall Street , part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman , Sachs and Co . 

Inc . 

" Rubin has done a fine job in that position , " said Michael Faust , a portfolio manager at <OOV> , Biehl and Kaiser , which manages just under $ 0 billion in global stocks and bonds . 

" Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill . " 

Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to <OOV> policy could spell trouble for financial markets . 

Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening . 

As for U.S. Treasury securities , <OOV> explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury . 

" Although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States , " said <OOV> , adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds . 

Still , markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results . 

If that is true , then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency . 

" If he left , the first question people would ask the next guy is , ' What 's your view on the dollar ? ' 

" said Michael <OOV> , portfolio manager of <OOV> International Funds . 

" And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they 'd better say exactly the same thing ( as Rubin ) , if not stronger , " <OOV> said . " 

Otherwise , you get selling out of Tokyo and Frankfurt again . "

French central defender Antoine Kombouare has completed a 000,000 pounds sterling ( $ 000,000 ) move to Aberdeen from Swiss club Sion , the Scottish premier division club said on Friday . 

Kombouare has signed a two-year contract and will make his debut against Morton in the Scottish League Cup on Tuesday . 

But he will be ineligible for the rest of Aberdeen 's UEFA Cup campaign as he has already played for Sion in this season 's Cup Winners ' Cup . 

Aberdeen manager Roy Aitken said : " It 's unfortunate for us that Antoine cannot play in Europe but he will help us achieve things in domestic competition . 

" I have been watching him for several weeks now and have no doubts he brings real quality to the side . 

He has a great deal of experience and I 'm sure he will quickly establish himself in both the team and the affection of our fans . " 

The 00-year-old defender played seven seasons with Nantes and was with Paris St Germain for five seasons . 

He said former PSG team mate David Ginola , who now plays for English premier league Newcastle , was influential in his move to Scotland . 

" I 'm a very good friend of David and spoke to him recently about coming to Aberdeen and he was very positive about it , " Kombouare said . 

" He said I would really enjoy life there and that I would settle in in terms of football as well . 

That , and the fact he is only a few hours drive away , influenced my decision to come to Aberdeen . "
