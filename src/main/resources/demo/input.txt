CRICKET - <OOV> TAKE OVER AT TOP AFTER INNINGS VICTORY . 

LONDON 0000-00-00 

West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 00 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 00 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship . 

Their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals Essex , Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire . 

After bowling Somerset out for 00 on the opening morning at Grace Road , Leicestershire extended their first innings by 00 runs before being bowled out for 000 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 00 . 

Trailing by 000 , Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 000 . 

Essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley . 

Hussain , considered surplus to England 's one-day requirements , struck 000 , his first championship century of the season , as Essex reached 000 and took a first innings lead of 00 . 

By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a <OOV> advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 00 in 00 balls and leaving them hanging on 000 for five and praying for rain . 

At the Oval , Surrey captain Chris Lewis , another man dumped by England , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 00 on Thursday with 00 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire . 

He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 00 as Surrey closed on 000 for seven , a lead of 000 . 

Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 0000 by reducing Worcestershire to 000 for five in their second innings , still 000 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat . 

Australian Tom Moody took six for 00 but Chris Adams , 000 , and Tim O'Gorman , 000 , took Derbyshire to 000 and a first innings lead of 000 . 

After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 000 . 

They were held up by a gritty 00 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 00 . 

By stumps Kent had reached 000 for three .
